Any Concepts TS or Coroutines TS implemented by your compiler is automatically detected and used.\nPartially working compilers (this was last updated January 2019):\n clang 3.5 - 3.9 can compile varying degrees of the test suite, the problem is lack of complete and unbuggy C++ 14 language support. Older point releases of GCCs 7 and 8 have internal compiler error bugs in their constexpr implementation which tend to be triggered by using Outcome in constexpr. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use Outcome in constexpr, you won\u0026rsquo;t see these problems. If you need your GCC to not ICE, upgrade to the very latest point release, the constexpr ICE has been since fixed. Early editions of Visual Studio 2017 have many corner case problems. The latest point release, VS2017.9, only has a few known problems, and should be relatively unsurprising for most use cases.  \u0026ldquo;C++ 14\u0026rdquo; compilers which do not work, and will not work until their maintainers fix them:\n GCC 5, due to a bug in nested template variables parsing which was fixed in GCC 6. I appreciate that this upsets a lot of users. Please raise your upset at https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/. In the meantime, you can get fairly far in Outcome with even clang 3.5. Any compiler which uses the libstdc++ version which comes with GCC 5, as it does not implement enough of the C++ 14 standard library for Outcome to compile.  "

	"content": " Usage as a single header file Outcome v2 comes in single header file form. This is regenerated per commit. To fetch on Linux:\nwget https://github.com/ned14/outcome/raw/master/single-header/outcome.hpp  On BSD:\nfetch https://github.com/ned14/outcome/raw/master/single-header/outcome.hpp  If you have curl installed:\ncurl -O -J -L https://github.com/ned14/outcome/raw/master/single-header/outcome.hpp  Otherwise, simply download the raw file from above and place it wherever it suits you. If you might be debugging using Microsoft Visual Studio, you may find the debugger visualisation file at https://github.com/ned14/outcome/raw/master/include/outcome/outcome.natvis useful to include into your build.\nUsage from the vcpkg package manager This is particularly easy, and works on Mac OS, Linux and Microsoft Windows:\nvcpkg install outcome  Outcome appears at \u0026lt;outcome/outcome.hpp\u0026gt;. This is a full copy of Outcome, so Experimental Outcome and all the usual headers are where you would expect.\nUsage from the Conan package manager (thanks to Théo Delrieu for contributing this support)\nAt the command line, add the bintray repo for Outcome to conan:\nconan remote add outcome https://api.bintray.com/conan/ned14/Outcome  Now simply add this to your Conan build:\n[requires] Outcome/master@ned14/stable  Outcome will be made available by Conan at \u0026lt;outcome.hpp\u0026gt;.\nUsage from the cmake hunter package manager Outcome has not been submitted to the main cmake hunter package manager repo yet. You can however add it as a git submodule:\ncd yourthirdpartyrepodir git submodule add https://github.com/ned14/quickcpplib git submodule add https://github.com/ned14/outcome cd .. git submodule update --init --recursive  Now tell cmake hunter about a git submoduled cmake hunter package by adding to your project\u0026rsquo;s cmake/Hunter/config.cmake:\nhunter_config(quickcpplib GIT_SUBMODULE \u0026quot;yourthirdpartyrepodir/quickcpplib\u0026quot;) hunter_config(outcome GIT_SUBMODULE \u0026quot;yourthirdpartyrepodir/outcome\u0026quot;)  \u0026hellip; and finally to your CMakeLists.txt, now add outcome as if it were an ordinary cmake hunter package:\nhunter_add_package(quickcpplib) find_package(quickcpplib CONFIG REQUIRED) hunter_add_package(outcome) find_package(outcome CONFIG REQUIRED)  Now you tell cmake to link to outcome as usual (see below for cmake targets):\ntarget_link_libraries(mytarget outcome::hl)  Usage as a git submodule If you are very keen on tracking very latest Outcome, you can add it as a git submodule to your project so you can keep abreast of bug fixes. Here is how:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/ned14/outcome cd outcome git checkout master git submodule update --init --recursive  After this you can bring Outcome into your code using:\n#include \u0026quot;outcome/single-header/outcome.hpp\u0026quot;  That\u0026rsquo;s it, you are ready to go. From time to time, you may wish to update to latest:\ncd outcome git pull git submodule update  Usage as a stable source tarball If you would prefer a single source tarball of the stable and develop branches known to have had all unit tests passing on all platforms, containing all the documentation, tests and sources, this can always be retrieved from:\nhttps://github.com/ned14/outcome/releases\nThis tarball is automatically generated when Outcome fully compiles and passes all unit tests on all platforms tested by the CIs. This currently includes:\n Linux: GCC 7.5, clang 9, clang 11 MacOS: XCode 12 Windows: VS2019.7  All unit tests are executed under the Address and Undefined Behaviour sanitisers.\nIt should be emphasised that newer compilers are not tested, so there is an unlikely chance that the tarball may not work on a newer compiler.\n Running the unit test suite To run the unit test suite you will need cmake 3.3 or later installed.\nmkdir build cd build cmake .. cmake --build . ctest  On some cmake generators (Visual Studio, Xcode) you may need to tell cmake build a configuration like Release or Debug. Similarly, ctest needs to be told the same e.g.\nmkdir build cd build cmake .. cmake --build . --config Release ctest -C Release  Per commit, tests are run by Travis and uploaded to a CDash dashboard here.\n CMake find_package() imported targets support Outcome fully complies with cmake install, so by installing Outcome, it can be found by cmake\u0026rsquo;s find_package().\nmkdir build cd build cmake .. cmake --build . sudo cmake --build . --target install  Modular CMake build support If you are using Outcome in a CMake project, Outcome is a \u0026ldquo;modular cmake\u0026rdquo; project using only modern cmake 3 throughout. This lets you add the Outcome directory as a cmake subdirectory with no unexpected consequence on the rest of your cmake. You will need to be using cmake 3.3 or better.\nadd_subdirectory( \u0026quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/outcome\u0026quot; # path to outcome source \u0026quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/outcome\u0026quot; # your choice of where to put binaries EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL # please only lazy build outcome on demand )  Outcome\u0026rsquo;s cmake has the following useful products:\n outcome::hl (target): the Outcome header-only library. Add this to any target_link_libraries() in your cmake to bring in Outcome as a header-only library. This will also add to your link (via PUBLIC) any debugger visualisation support files, any system library dependencies and also force all consuming executables to be configured with a minimum of C++ 14 as Outcome requires a minimum of that. outcome_TEST_TARGETS (list): a list of targets which generate Outcome\u0026rsquo;s test suite. You can append this to your own test suite if you wish to run Outcome\u0026rsquo;s test suite along with your own.  "

At some point namespace outcome_v2 will be defined, and this will be the preferred namespace. Until then OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE denotes the most recently updated version, getting closer to outcome_v2.\nOn Boost.Outcome only, as Boost provides no binary compatibility across releases, OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE always expands into boost::outcome_v2.\nOnline compilers If you\u0026rsquo;ve never used them before, you will find Godbolt and Wandbox invaluable. These let you play with C++ inside your web browser.\nMost of the source code snippets in Outcome have a link in their top right to the original source code on github. You can copy and paste this source code into Godbolt (if you wish to study the assembler generated) or Wandbox (if you wish to run the program).\nGodbolt Godbolt is invaluable for visualising online the assembler generated for a piece of C++, for all the major compilers and CPU architectures.\nStandalone Outcome is built into Godbolt! In the right hand pane toolbar, click the libraries dropdown (currently third from the right, looks like a book), find Outcome and choose the version you want.\nAfter this is selected, you can #include any of these editions of Outcome:\n \u0026lt;outcome-basic.hpp\u0026gt; An inclusion of basic_outcome.hpp + try.hpp which includes as few system headers as possible in order to give an absolute minimum compile time impact edition of Outcome. See https://github.com/ned14/stl-header-heft.  \u0026lt;outcome-experimental.hpp\u0026gt; An inclusion of experimental/status_outcome.hpp + try.hpp which is the low compile time impact of the basic edition combined with status_code from https://ned14.github.io/status-code/. If you are on an embedded system where binary bloat must be absolutely avoided, and don't mind the potentially unstable status_code, this is definitely the edition for you.  \u0026lt;outcome.hpp\u0026gt; An inclusion of outcome.hpp which brings in all the specialisations for the std STL types, plus iostreams support. If you don't know which edition to use, you should use this one, it ought to \"just work\".  Here is the first tutorial topic\u0026rsquo;s source code loaded into Godbolt: https://godbolt.org/z/4of3c8\nWandbox Wandbox lets you place a third party header into a separate tab.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Back in the essential tutorial section on result, we studied a likely very common initial choice of E type: a strongly typed enum. We saw how by marking up strongly typed enums to tell the C++ standard library what they are, they gain implicit convertibility into std::error_code, and we then pointed out that you might as well now always set E = std::error_code, as that comes with the enormous advantage that you can use the boilerplate saving OUTCOME_TRY macro when the E type is always the same.\nWe thus strongly recommend to users that for any given piece of code, always using the same E type across the codebase is very wise, except where you explicitly want to prevent implicit propagation of failure up a call stack e.g. local failures in some domain specific piece of code.\nHowever it is unreasonable to expect that any non-trivial codebase can make do with E = std::error_code. This is why Outcome allows you to use custom E types which carry payload in addition to an error code, yet still have that custom type treated as if a std::error_code, including lazy custom exception throw synthesis.\nAll this is good, but if library A uses result\u0026lt;T, libraryA::failure_info\u0026gt;, and library B uses result\u0026lt;T, libraryB::error_info\u0026gt; and so on, there becomes a problem for the application writer who is bringing in these third party dependencies and tying them together into an application. As a general rule, each third party library author will not have built in explicit interoperation support for unknown other third party libraries. The problem therefore lands with the application writer.\nThe application writer has one of three choices:\n In the application, the form of result used is result\u0026lt;T, std::variant\u0026lt;E1, E2, ...\u0026gt;\u0026gt; where E1, E2 \u0026hellip; are the failure types for every third party library in use in the application. This has the advantage of preserving the original information exactly, but comes with a certain amount of use inconvenience and maybe excessive coupling between high level layers and implementation detail.\n One can translate/map the third party\u0026rsquo;s failure type into the application\u0026rsquo;s failure type at the point of the failure exiting the third party library and entering the application. One might do this, say, with a C preprocessor macro wrapping every invocation of the third party API from the application. This approach may lose the original failure detail, or mis-map under certain circumstances if the mapping between the two systems is not one-one.\n One can type erase the third party\u0026rsquo;s failure type into some application failure type, which can later be reconstituted if necessary. This is the cleanest solution with the least coupling issues and no problems with mis-mapping, but it almost certainly requires the use of malloc, which the previous two did not.\n  Things get even more complicated in the presence of callbacks. If in the callback you supply to library A, you call library B, you may need to insert switch statement maps or other mechanisms to convert library B\u0026rsquo;s failures into something library A can understand, and then somehow extract that out \u0026ndash; preferably without loss of original information \u0026ndash; into the application\u0026rsquo;s failure handling mechanism if library A subsequently returns failure as well. This implies transmitting state by which to track these interrelated pieces of failure data.\nLet us see what Outcome can do to help the application writer address some of these issues, next.\n"

	"content": "The main advantages of choosing \u0026lt;outcome/experimental\u0026gt; over default Outcome:\n Codegen is tighter and less verbose1, sometimes remarkably so.\n Build time impact is markedly lower, barely above the inclusion of naked \u0026lt;basic_result.hpp\u0026gt;, as the STL allocator machinery and std::string et al is not dragged into inclusion by including \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt;. Note that \u0026lt;outcome/experimental/status_outcome.hpp\u0026gt; bring in \u0026lt;exception\u0026gt;, however \u0026lt;outcome/experimental/status_result.hpp\u0026gt; brings in no extra system headers.\n More discipline is imposed on your use of Outcome, leading to less ambiguous code which is easier to optimise by the compiler, lower cost to maintain, and lower cognitive load to audit code based on experimental Outcome for correctness.\n Code written to \u0026lt;outcome/experimental\u0026gt; can be fairly easily dual targeted, with just a few switching type aliases, to default Outcome. This author has several Outcome-based libraries with identical source code which can target either configuration of Outcome. The experimental Outcome build regularly beats the default Outcome build in benchmarks by 2-3%, and the dual target source code, being written to tighter discipline, is faster and more deterministic in the default target than it was before the (non-trivial) port to \u0026lt;outcome/experimental\u0026gt;.\n  If you are building a codebase on top of Outcome expecting long term maintenance, the author\u0026rsquo;s personal recommendation is that you design, write, test and optimise it for \u0026lt;outcome/experimental\u0026gt;. What you ship to your customers ought to be targeted at default Outcome however, so employ type aliases and macros as appropriate to switch the build configuration for production releases. This is what the Outcome author does himself, to date with great success, despite the fundamental architectural differences between \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; and proposed \u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt;.\n Boost.System\u0026rsquo;s error_code has incorporated some of the design improvements of experimental status_code, and produces codegen somewhere in between experimental status_code and std::error_code.

Besides, outcome has a converting constructor overload for result inputs which is constexpr capable.\nNote that if you do enable outcome inputs, a result will match an input outcome, but silently dropping any exception state.

	"description": "",
	"content": " At the end of December 2021, as had been intended and signposted from the beginning of development, standalone Outcome v2.2.3 locked its ABI such that any code built with this Outcome release shall link, without recompilation, with any code built with any future Outcome release. This means that going forth, you are guaranteed that if your library returns an outcome::result\u0026lt;T, E = varies, NoValuePolicy = policy::default_policy\u0026lt;T, E, void\u0026gt;\u0026gt; or outcome::outcome\u0026lt;T, EC = varies, EP = varies, NoValuePolicy = policy::default_policy\u0026lt;T, EC, EP\u0026gt;\u0026gt; from a public API, consumers of your library are guaranteed 100% compatibility with unrecompiled library binaries when using any future version of Outcome in consuming code.\nThis is a critical use case for many large scale production use cases in industry, and to my knowledge, no other Outcome-like alternative implements this guarantee at the time of writing1. Note also that Boost.Outcome comes with no ABI guarantees, as the dependencies within Boost that Boost.Outcome uses do not have a stable ABI guarantee.\nTo ensure this guarantee going forth, a per commit CI step has been added which tests Outcome against the v2.2.3 ABI using these tools:\n The ABI compliance checker (using its abi-dumper mode, not its translation unit parsing mode which is too brittle). Sourceware\u0026rsquo;s libabigail tooling.  Both tools are independent of one another, and whilst they test using the same mechanism (DWARF debug info extracted from an unoptimised shared library object), they have different implementations.\nABI testing implementation notes Outcome is a header only library, so to turn Outcome into a shared library suitable as input for these tools, we compile a dummy shared library which exports APIs which use Outcome. The coverage of that dummy shared library of Outcome is therefore what is actually ABI tested, rather than of Outcome itself. The dummy library locks the ABI for:\n basic_result\u0026lt;trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt; (i.e. union storage layout) basic_outcome\u0026lt;trivial type, std::error_code, trivial type, all policies\u0026gt; basic_result\u0026lt;non-trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt; (i.e. struct storage layout) basic_outcome\u0026lt;non-trivial type, std::error_code, std::exception_ptr, all policies\u0026gt; bad_result_access_with\u0026lt;std::error_code\u0026gt; bad_outcome_access atomic_eager\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; atomic_eager\u0026lt;basic_result\u0026lt;trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt;\u0026gt; atomic_eager\u0026lt;basic_result\u0026lt;non-trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt;\u0026gt; atomic_lazy\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; atomic_lazy\u0026lt;basic_result\u0026lt;trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt;\u0026gt; atomic_lazy\u0026lt;basic_result\u0026lt;non-trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt;\u0026gt; eager\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; eager\u0026lt;basic_result\u0026lt;trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt;\u0026gt; eager\u0026lt;basic_result\u0026lt;non-trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt;\u0026gt; lazy\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; lazy\u0026lt;basic_result\u0026lt;trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt;\u0026gt; lazy\u0026lt;basic_result\u0026lt;non-trivial type, std::error_code, all policies\u0026gt;\u0026gt;  Obviously anything which any of these types touch in their implementation also gets locked in ABI, in so far as the ABI tool can deduce dependent types. If you examine the source code for the dummy shared library, you will see that we go out of our way to encode explicit lists of dependent types in template parameters, to ensure that the ABI tool definitely discovers everything.\nOutcome.Experimental has no ABI guarantees, as WG21 LEWG is actively modifying its design as it approaches the C++ standard.\n The following targets are tested for ABI stability:\n GCC 7.5 with libstdc++ configured with the C++ 14 standard and x64 architecture.\n GCC 9.3 with libstdc++ configured with the C++ 17 standard and x64 architecture.\n  At the time of writing, no POSIX implementation has guaranteed stability on its C++ 20 standard library ABI, so we do not test that.\nThere is currently no CI coverage of MSVC ABI stability. The ABI compliance checker can test MSVC binaries for ABI stability, however raising the ABI compliance checker on a Github Actions Windows test runner is quite a lot of work. Donations of sufficient test scripting would be welcome. Note that because the Windows and POSIX implementation is almost the same, ABI stability on POSIX will have strong impact on MSVC ABI stability i.e. MSVC ABI is unlikely to break, albeit without CI testing there are no guarantees.\n libstdc++ implements a strong ABI stability guarantee and thus any future std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; implementation it provides will be ABI stable. However Expected offers only a small subset of the functionality which outcome::result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; provides. [return]   "

	"title": "Exceptions",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "Exceptions with their good and bad sides.",
	"content": " Exceptions are the default mechanism in C++ for reporting, propagating and processing the information about function failures. Their main advantage is the ability to describe the \u0026ldquo;success dependency\u0026rdquo; between functions: if you want to say that calling function g() depends on the successful execution of function f(), you just put g() below f() and that\u0026rsquo;s it:\nint a() { f(); g(); // don\u0026#39;t call g() and further if f() fails  return h(); // don\u0026#39;t call h() if g() fails }  In the C++ Standard terms this means that f() is sequenced before g(). This makes failure handling extremely easy: in a lot of cases you do not have to do anything.\nAlso, while next operations are being canceled, the exception object containing the information about the initial failure is kept on the side. When at some point the cancellation cascade is stopped by an exception handler, the exception object can be inspected. It can contain arbitrarily big amount of data about the failure reason, including the entire call stack.\nDownsides There are two kinds of overheads caused by the exception handling mechanism. The first is connected with storing the exceptions on the side. Stack unwinding works independently in each thread of execution; each thread can be potentially handling a number of exceptions (even though only one exception can be active in one thread). This requires being prepared for storing an arbitrary number of exceptions of arbitrary types per thread. Additional things like jump tables also need to be stored in the program binaries.\nSecond overhead is experienced when throwing an exception and trying to find the handler. Since nearly any function can throw an exception of any time, this is a dynamic memory allocation. The type of an exception is erased and a run-time type identification (RTTI) is required to asses the type of the active exception object. The worst case time required for matching exceptions against handlers cannot be easily predicted and therefore exceptions are not suitable for real-time or low-latency systems.\nAnother problem connected with exceptions is that while they are good for program flows with linear \u0026ldquo;success dependency\u0026rdquo;, they become inconvenient in situations where this success dependency does not occur. One such notable example is releasing acquired resources which needs to be performed even if previous operations have failed. Another example is when some function c() depends on the success of at least one of two functions a() and b() (which try, for instance, to store user data by two different means), another example is when implementing a strong exception safety guarantee we may need to apply some fallback actions when previous operations have failed. When failures are reported by exceptions, the semantics of canceling all subsequent operations is a hindrance rather than help; these situations require special and non-trivial idioms to be employed.\nFor these reasons in some projects using exceptions is forbidden. Compilers offer switches to disable exceptions altogether (they refuse to compile a throw, and turn already compiled throws into calls to std::abort()).\n"

	"content": "C++ has excellent two-way compatibility with the C ABI, but there are some limitations you must observe to write C++ code which C code can call without marshalling at the ABI boundary:\n A C++ function may not throw exceptions if it is safe to call from C, and so should always be marked noexcept.\n A C++ function should be annotated with extern \u0026quot;C\u0026quot; to prevent its symbol being mangled, and thus give it the C rather than C++ ABI.\n You cannot use overloading in your extern \u0026quot;C\u0026quot; functions.\n You may only use types in your C++ function declaration for which these traits are both true:\n std::is_standard_layout_v\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; std::is_trivially_copyable_v\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;  (Note that std::is_trivially_copyable_v\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; requires trivial destruction, but NOT trivial construction. This means that C++ can do non-trivial construction of otherwise trivial types)\n  The above is what the standard officially requires for well defined C and C++ interop. However, all of the three major compilers MSVC, GCC and clang are considerably more relaxed. In those three major compilers, \u0026ldquo;almost-standard-layout\u0026rdquo; C++ types work fine in C.\n\u0026ldquo;Almost-standard-layout\u0026rdquo; C++ types have these requirements:\n No virtual functions or virtual base classes i.e. std::is_polymorphic_v\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; must be false. This is because the vptrs offset the proper front of the data layout in an unknowable way to C. Non-static data members of reference type appear to C as pointers. You must never supply from C to C++ a non-null pointer which is seen as a reference in C++. C++ inheritance is seen in C data layout as if the most derived class has nested variables of the inherited types at the top, in order of inheritance. Types with non-trivial destructors work fine so long as at least move construction and assignment is the same as copying bits like memcpy(). You just need to make sure instances of the type return to C++, and don\u0026rsquo;t get orphaned in C. This was referred to in previous pages in this section as \u0026ldquo;move relocating\u0026rdquo; types.  Experimental Outcome\u0026rsquo;s support for being used from C does not meet the current strict requirements, and thus relies on the (very common) implementation defined behaviour just described (it is hoped that future C++ standards can relax the requirements to those just described).\nSpecifically, proposed status_code is an almost-standard-layout type, and thus while it can\u0026rsquo;t be returned from extern \u0026quot;C\u0026quot; functions as the compiler will complain, it is perfectly safe to return from C++ functions to C code on the three major compilers, as it is an \u0026ldquo;almost-standard-layout\u0026rdquo; C++ type if T is an \u0026ldquo;almost-standard-layout\u0026rdquo; C++ type.\n"

This phase usually involves initialising member variables to various default values, most often using default member initialisers. Most standard C++ library objects and containers have constexpr constructors, and thus can be initialised during phase 1. If you need to initialise a member variable without a constexpr constructor,  std::optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; is the usual workaround.\n Do the remainder of the construction, the parts which could fail. Because phase 1 placed the object into a legally destructible state, it is usually the case that one can bail out during phase 2 and the destructor will clean things up correctly.\n  The phase 1 construction will be placed into a private constexpr constructor so nobody external can call it. The phase 2 construction will be placed into a static member initialisation function which returns a result with either the successfully constructed object, or the cause of any failure to construct the object.\nFinally, as a phase 3, some simple metaprogramming will implement a make\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;{Args...}() free function which will construct any object T by calling its static initialisation function with Args... and returning the result returned. This isn\u0026rsquo;t as nice as calling T(Args...) directly, but it\u0026rsquo;s not too bad in practice.

If there is, all implicit conversion is disabled, and you will need to use one of the tagged constructors:\noutcome::result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; r {outcome::in_place_type\u0026lt;std::error_code\u0026gt;, ConversionErrc::EmptyString}; outcome::result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; s {outcome::in_place_type\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;, 1}; View this code on Github Or use helper functions:\noutcome::result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; r = outcome::failure(ConversionErrc::EmptyString); outcome::result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; s = outcome::success(1); View this code on Github The functions auto failure(T \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, \u0026hellip;) and auto success(T \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, \u0026hellip;) return special types implicitly convertible to failed or successful result (and outcome).\n  You can mandate a choice using std_result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; or boost_result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;.

Table-based EH implementations are almost universal on x64, ARM and AArch64 targets).\nC++ exception throws came in the original C++ 98 standard \u0026ndash; at that time, not all the major compilers implemented them yet, and several of those who did did not have efficient implementations, plus in the original days some compiler vendors still patented things like EH implementation techniques to try and maintain a competitive advantage over rival compilers. Unlike other C++ features, enabling C++ exceptions on a code base not written with them in mind is not safe, so this led to the C++ ecosystem becoming bifurcated into exceptions-enabled and exceptions-disabled camps.\nPros:  Zero runtime overhead on the happy path.\n Success-orientated syntax declutters code of failure control flow paths.\n As a built-in language feature, probably has the least impact on optimisation of any failure handling mechanism here.\n Ships with every standard toolchain (though may not work in some, and cannot be safely enabled for many codebases).\n  Cons:  Unpredictable runtime overhead on the sad path.\n Unacceptable runtime overhead on the sad path for real time applications.\n Adds considerable bloat to produced binaries, which can be unacceptable for some use cases (embedded).\n Requires RTTI to be enabled or non-standard behaviour results (which is further binary bloat).\n Not available by tradition or convention in several major parts of the C++ ecosystem (embedded, games, audio, to a lesser extent financial).\n Not available in many niche architectures such as HPC, GPUs, DSPs and microcontrollers.\n Most codebases do not invest in adequate correctness testing of the silent proliferation of failure control flow paths which result in C++ exception throwing code (exception throws silently generate multitudes of slight variations of sad path control flows).\n  "

	"content": "In \u0026lt;outcome/experimental\u0026gt;, there ships an Outcome-based simulation of the proposed P1095 Zero overhead deterministic failure specific implementation of P0709 Zero overhead exceptions: Throwing values. This library-only implementation lets you use a close simulacrum of potential future C++ lightweight exceptions today in any C++ 14 compiler which Outcome supports.\nThis Experimental Outcome implementation has been in production use for some years now. It has shipped on at least one billion devices, as part of a games suite very popular on Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS and Google Android devices. It powers big iron enterprise applications as well, indeed all trades including futures in the United States are captured live into a database for the SEC by an Experimental Outcome based codebase. Finally, Experimental Outcome is used in the firmware of parts of driver assisting cars where its particularly rich and flexible failure added information combined with compatibility with globally disabled C++ exceptions proved to be a big win.\nThe base for failure handling in future C++ might be std::error from P1028 status_code. This proposal is currently being refined before WG21\u0026rsquo;s Library Evolution Working Group with the expectation that it will be standardised as a large enhancement and backwards compatible superset of std::error_code which is also capable of transporting any move-only type such as std::exception_ptr. Like std::error_code, proposed std::error occupies exactly two CPU registers of layout, and thus is extremely lightweight. It can wrap arbitrary third party error handling systems, and automatically constructs from std::error_code and std::exception_ptr, propagating the original underlying implementations (no matter how customised) exactly (e.g. boost::exception_ptr). Unlike \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt;, std::error does not have dependencies on expensive standard library headers, so including it into your global build has a very low build time impact. std::error knows how to throw itself as a conventional C++ exception, and knows how to losslessly consume arbitrary C++ exception throws. Finally, std::error is ABI stable, and is a P1029 move bitcopying type whereby moved-from objects do not need to be destroyed.\nExperimental Outcome uses the same proposed std::error object as P1095 would do for its E type by bundling internally a copy of https://ned14.github.io/status-code/, the reference implementation library for proposed std::error. Outcome emulates move bitcopying semantics for types declaring themselves move bitcopying via the trait is_move_bitcopying\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; , and status codes opt into this. This greatly improves codegen to be no worse than with std::error_code (a trivially copyable type), as https://godbolt.org/z/GEdEGc demonstrates, despite that proposed std::error is a move-only type with a non-trivial destructor.\nOutcome binds status_code into basic_result and basic_outcome customisations via the following headers:\n \u0026lt;outcome/experimental/status_result.hpp\u0026gt; \u0026lt;outcome/experimental/status_outcome.hpp\u0026gt;  These headers import the entire contents of the SYSTEM_ERROR2_NAMESPACE namespace into the OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::experimental namespace. You can thus address everything in SYSTEM_ERROR2_NAMESPACE via OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::experimental.\nAs P1095 also proposes C language support for lightweight C++ exceptions, experimental Outcome also has a macro-based C interface that enables C code to work with the C-compatible subset of status_result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;:\n \u0026lt;outcome/experimental/result.h\u0026gt;  For non-Windows non-POSIX platforms such as some embedded systems, standalone Experimental Outcome can be used with the SYSTEM_ERROR2_NOT_POSIX macro defined. This does not include POSIX headers, and makes available a high fidelity, fully deterministic, alternative to C++ exceptions on such platforms.\nFinally, there is a single include edition of Experimental Outcome, which can be found at https://github.com/ned14/outcome/blob/develop/single-header/outcome-experimental.hpp. You can play with this on godbolt by #include \u0026lt;outcome-experimental.hpp\u0026gt;.\nIt is stressed, in the strongest possible terms, that any item inside \u0026lt;outcome/experimental\u0026gt; is subject to unannounced breaking change based on WG21 standards committee feedback. That said, the chances are high that most of those breaking changes will be to naming rather than to fundamental semantics, so you can upgrade with a bit of find and replace.\n "

The class template result\u0026lt;\u0026gt; is declared with the attribute [[nodiscard]], which means the compiler will warn you if you forget to inspect the returned object (in C++ 17 or later).\nThe implementation will do the following: if the integral number can be represented by an int, we will convert to int and use its arithmetical operations.

The function .error() allows you to inspect the error sub-object, representing information about the reason for failure.\n#4. Macro OUTCOME_TRY represents a control statement. It implies that the expression in the second argument returns a result\u0026lt;\u0026gt;. The function is defined as:\n/*static*/ outcome::result\u0026lt;BigInt\u0026gt; BigInt::fromString(const std::string\u0026amp; s) View this code on Github Our control statement means: if fromString returned failure, this same error information should be returned from print_half, even though the type of result\u0026lt;\u0026gt; is different. If fromString returned success, we create variable i of type BigInt with the value returned from fromString. If control goes to subsequent line, it means fromString succeeded and variable of type BigInt is in scope.\n#5. In the return statement we extract the error information and use it to initialize the return value from print_half. We could have written return r.error(); instead, and it would have the same effect, but r.as_failure() will work when implicit construction from E has been disabled due to T and E having a constructibility relationship.\n#6.

	"description": "",
	"content": "The major design differences between \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; and proposed \u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt; are as follows:\n experimental::status_code\u0026lt;DomainType\u0026gt; can represent warnings and form-of-success codes as well as failure codes. experimental::errored_status_code\u0026lt;DomainType\u0026gt; is more similar to std::error_code, in that it can only represent failures (this is enforced by C++ 20 contract or runtime assertion check).\n The code\u0026rsquo;s domain implementation defines the payload type to be transported around by experimental::status_code\u0026lt;DomainType\u0026gt;, rather than it being hardcoded to int as in std::error_code. The payload type can be anything you like, including non-trivially-copyable, move-only, complex etc types.\nThis facility is extremely useful. Extra failure metadata such as stack backtraces can be returned, for example. You can absolutely vary the payload depending on whether NDEBUG or _DEBUG is defined, too.\n If your domain defines a payload type which is trivially copyable or move relocating1, it gains an implicit convertibility to a move-only experimental::status_code\u0026lt;erased\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026gt; where T is another trivially copyable or move relocating type. This permits global headers to use a single, common, type erased, status code type which is highly desirable for code bases of any complexity. However, unlike std::error_code, which fulfils the exact same role in \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; based code, the type erased payload can be bigger than the hardcoded int in std::error_code.\nThis facility is also extremely useful, as extra failure metadata can be type erased, transported through code with no knowledge of such things, and the original type with failure metadata resurrected at the handling point. Indeed P1095 proposed std::error is a type alias to experimental::status_code\u0026lt;erased\u0026lt;intptr_t\u0026gt;\u0026gt;, and it can transport erased std::exception_ptr instances, POSIX error codes, and much more besides.\n Equality comparisons between status code\u0026rsquo;s with non-identical domains are always semantic i.e. are they semantically equivalent, rather than exactly equal? This mirrors when you compare std::error_code to a std::error_condition, but as there is no equivalent for the latter in \u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt;, this means that when you see the code:\nif(code1 == code2) ...  \u0026hellip; you can be highly confident that this is an inexact, semantic, match operation. The same code under \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; is highly ambiguous as to whether exact or inexact comparison is being performed (after all, all there is is \u0026ldquo;code1 == code2\u0026rdquo;, so it depends on the types of code1 and code2 which usually is not obvious).\nThe ambiguity, and high cognitive load during auditing \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; code for correctness, has led to many surprising and unexpected failure handling bugs during the past decade in production C++.\n \u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt;, being a new design, has all-constexpr construction and destruction which avoids the need for static global variables, as \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; has. Each of those static global variables requires an atomic fence just in case it has not been initialised, thus every retrieval of an error category bloats code and inhibits optimisation, plus makes the use of custom error code categories in header-only libraries unreliable. Boost.System has replicated the all-constexpr construction and destruction from \u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt;, and thus now has similar characteristics in this regard.\n Finally, this is a small but important difference. Under \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt;, this extremely common use case is ambiguous:\nif(ec) ...  Does this code mean \u0026ldquo;if there was an error?\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;if the error code is set?\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;is the error code non-zero?\u0026rdquo;. The correct answer according to the standard is the last choice, but a quick survey of open source \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; based code on github quickly demonstrates there is widespread confusion regarding correct usage.\n\u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt; solves this by removing the boolean test entirely. One now writes if(sc.success()) ..., if(sc.failure()) ..., if(sc.empty()) ... and so on, thus eliminating ambiguity.\n   Move relocating is not in the standard, it is currently within WG21 Evolution Working Group Incubator. It is defined to be a type whose move constructor memcpy()\u0026rsquo;s the bits from source to destination, followed by memcpy() of the bits of a default constructed instance to source, and with a programmer-given guarantee that the destructor, when called on a default constructed instance, has no observable side effects. A surprising number of standard library types can meet this definition of move relocating, including std::vector\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;, std::shared_ptr\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;, and std::exception_ptr.

	"description": "",
	"content": "In the start of 2020, after a year of listening to user feedback since entering Boost, Outcome v2.2 was published with a number of breaking source changes from Outcome v2.1 The full year of 2020 (three Boost releases) was given to announcing those upcoming changes, and testing the v2.2 branch in production. In late December 2020, Outcome v2.2 became the default Outcome, and all Outcome v2.1 code shall need to be upgraded to work with v2.2.\nTo upgrade an Outcome v2.1 based codebase to Outcome v2.2 is very easy:\n You will need a tool capable of finding regular expressions in all source files in a directory tree and replacing them \u0026ndash; most IDEs such as Visual Studio have such a tool with GUI, on POSIX a shell script such as this ought to work:\nfind /path/to/project -type f -name \u0026quot;*.hpp\u0026quot; | xargs sed -i \u0026quot;s/_TRY\\(([^(]*?),(.*?)\\);/_TRY((auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, \\1),\\2);/g\u0026quot; find /path/to/project -type f -name \u0026quot;*.cpp\u0026quot; | xargs sed -i \u0026quot;s/_TRY\\(([^(]*?),(.*?)\\);/_TRY((auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, \\1),\\2);/g\u0026quot; find /path/to/project -type f -name \u0026quot;*.hpp\u0026quot; | xargs sed -i \u0026quot;s/_TRY\\(([^(]*?)\\);/_TRYV2(auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, \\1);/g\u0026quot; find /path/to/project -type f -name \u0026quot;*.cpp\u0026quot; | xargs sed -i \u0026quot;s/_TRY\\(([^(]*?)\\);/_TRYV2(auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, \\1);/g\u0026quot;  The transformation needed are the regular expressions _TRY\\(([^(]*?),(.*?)\\); =\u0026gt; _TRY((auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, \\1),\\2); and TRY\\(([^(]*?)\\); =\u0026gt; _TRYV2(auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, \\1);. This is because in Outcome v2.2 onwards, OUTCOME_TRY(var, expr) no longer implicitly declares the variable created as auto\u0026amp;\u0026amp; on your behalf, now you must specify the storage of the variable. It also declares the internal uniquely named temporary as a value rather than as a reference, the initial brackets overrides this to force the use of a rvalue reference for the internal uniquely named temporary instead.\nThis makes use of Outcome\u0026rsquo;s new TRY syntax to tell the TRY operation to use references rather than values for the internal uniquely named temporary, thus avoiding any copies and moves. The only way to override the storage of the internal uniquely named temporary for non-value outputting TRY is via the new OUTCOME_TRYV2() which takes the storage specifier you desire as its first parameter.\nThe principle advantage of this change is that you can now assign to existing variables the successful results of expressions, instead of being forced to TRY into a new variable, and move that variable into the destination you intended. Also, because you can now specify storage, you can now assign the result of a TRYied operation into static or thread local storage.\n The find regex and replace rule above is to preserve exact semantics with Outcome v2.1 whereby the internal uniquely named temporary and the variable for the value are both rvalue references. If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling like more work, it is safer if you convert as many OUTCOME_TRY((auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, v), expr) to OUTCOME_TRY(auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;v, expr) as possible. This will mean that TRY \u0026lsquo;consumes\u0026rsquo; expr i.e. moves it into the internal uniquely named temporary, if expr is an rvalue reference. Usually this does not affect existing code, but occasionally it can, generally a bit of code reordering will fix it.\n If your code uses the ADL discovered event hooks to intercept when basic_result and basic_outcome is constructed, copies or moved, you will need to either define the macro OUTCOME_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPPORT_FOR to less than 220 to enable emulation, or upgrade the code to use the new mechanism.\nThe hooks themselves have identical signature, only the name and location has changed. Therefore upgrade is usually a case of copy-pasting the hook implementation into a custom NoValuePolicy implementation, and changing the ADL free function\u0026rsquo;s name from hook_* to on_*.\nYou are recommended to upgrade if possible, as the ADL discovered hooks were found in real world code usage to be brittle and surprising.\n Any usage of CamelCase named concepts from Outcome must be replaced with snake_case named concepts instead:\n concepts::ValueOrError\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; concepts::value_or_error\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; concepts::ValueOrNone\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; concepts::value_or_none\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;  The CamelCase naming is aliased to the snake_case naming if the macro OUTCOME_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPPORT_FOR is defined to less than 220. Nevertheless you ought to upgrade here is possible, as due to a late change in C++ 20 all standard concepts are now snake_case named.\n Finally, despite that Outcome does not currently offer a stable ABI guarantee (hoped to begin in 2022), v2.1 had a stable storage layout for basic_result and basic_outcome. In v2.2 that storage layout has changed, so the ABIs generated by use of v2.1 and v2.2 are incompatible i.e. you will need to recompile everything using Outcome after you upgrade to v2.2.\n  "

On failure, as the template alias fs_result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; above it shows, we are returning a failure_info structure containing an error code and the same additional information as filesystem_error provides.\nIt is important to note that the fact that failure_info is defined in namespace filesystem2 is very important. This is because Outcome uses Argument Dependent Lookup (ADL) to find the make_error_code() function, as well as other customisation point free functions. In other words, only the namespaces as defined by ADL are searched when finding a free function telling us what to do for failure_info, which includes the namespace failure_info is declared into.\n"

	"content": " The idiom of returning, upon failure, a special value and storing an error code (an int) inside a global (or thread-local) object errno is inherited from C, and used in its Standard Library:\nint readValue(const char * filename) { FILE* f = fopen(filename, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;); if (f == NULL) return 0; // special value indicating failure  // keep errno value set by fopen()  int i; int r = fscanf(f, \u0026#34;%d\u0026#34;, \u0026amp;i); if (r == 0 || r == EOF) { // special values: i not read  errno = ENODATA; // choose error value to return  return 0; fclose(f); errno = 0; // clear error info (success)  return i; }  One advantage (to some, and a disadvantage to others) of this technique is that it uses familiar control statements (if and return) to indicate all execution paths that handle failures. When we read this code we know when and under what conditions it can exit without producing the expected result.\nDownsides Because on failure, as well as success, we write into a global (or thread-local) object, our functions are not pure: they have side effects. This means many useful compiler optimizations (like common subexpression elimination) cannot be applied. This shows that it is not only C++ that chooses suboptimal solutions for reporting failures.\nWhatever type we return, we always need a special value to spare, which is sometimes troublesome. In the above example, if the successfully read value of i is 0, and we return it, our callers will think it is a failure even though it is not.\nError propagation using if statements and early returns is manual. We can easily forget to check for the failure, and incorrectly let the subsequent operations execute, potentially causing damage to the program state.\nUpon nearly each function call layer we may have to change error code value so that it reflects the error condition adequate to the current layer. If we do so, the original error code is gone.\n"

Failure can be represented by EC, or EP, or both, although usually it will either be an EC or an EP. Similarly to result, EC defaults to std::error_code/boost::system::error_code, and EP defaults to std::exception_ptr/boost::exception_ptr.\nThe distinction is made into two types, EC and EP:\n EC represents a recoverable failure from a lower-layer function, perhaps which was returned through result\u0026lt;T, E = varies, NoValuePolicy = policy::default_policy\u0026lt;T, E, void\u0026gt;\u0026gt; . EP represents an unrecoverable failure where a C++ exception would ordinarily have been thrown. This is usually a pointer to an exception throw.  It should be emphasised that this distinction is by convention only, but it will be confusing to your users if you deviate significantly from this convention.\n Legacy codebases outcome is useful for transporting exceptions across layers of the program that were never designed with exception safety in mind.\nConsider a program consisting of three layers:\nmermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true}); graph BT L3[\"Layer3\"] L2[\"Layer2_old\"] -- L3 L1[\"Layer1\"] -- L2   The highest-level layer, Layer3, uses exceptions for signalling failures. The middle layer, Layer2_old, was not designed with exception safety in mind and functions need to return information about failures in return value. But down in the implementation details, in Layer1, another library is used that again throws exceptions. The goal is to be able to transfer an exception thrown in Layer1 through Layer2_old, which is not exception-safe, and be able to rethrow it in Layer3.\nIn Layer1 we have two functions from two libraries: one reports failures by throwing exceptions, the other by returning result\u0026lt;\u0026gt;:\nauto f() -\u0026gt; int; // throws on failure auto g() noexcept -\u0026gt; outcome::result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;; View this code on Github In Layer2_old we cannot use exceptions, so its function h uses return type outcome\u0026lt;\u0026gt; to report failures. It is using functions f and g and reports their failures inside outcome\u0026lt;\u0026gt;:\nauto old::h() noexcept -\u0026gt; outcome::outcome\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; { OUTCOME_TRY(auto i, (g())); // #1  try { return i + f(); } catch (...) { return std::current_exception(); // #2  } } View this code on Github #1. Operator TRY can forward failures encoded in result\u0026lt;T, EC\u0026gt; as outcome\u0026lt;T, EC, EP\u0026gt; without any loss in information. You can also use TRY to forward failure from one outcome\u0026lt;\u0026gt; to another.\n#2. You can store the current exception through std::exception_ptr inside outcome\u0026lt;T, EC, EP\u0026gt; without any loss in information (provided that EP is std::exception_ptr).\n"

They are a simple trivially copyable type offering improved type safety and functionality over C enumerations. You can read more about how std::error_code works here. They were standardised in the C++ 11 standard, and have been available in Boost since 2008.\nPros:  Predictable runtime overhead on the happy path.\n Predictable runtime overhead on the sad path.\n Unbiased syntax equal for both success and failure requiring explicit code written to handle both.\n Very little codegen bloat added to binaries (though there is a fixed absolute overhead for support libraries).\n Once constructed, passing around std::error_code instances optimises well, often being passed in CPU registers.\n Works well in all configurations of C++, including C++ exceptions and RTTI globally disabled.\n Works well on all niche architectures, such as HPC, GPUs, DSPs and microcontrollers.\n Ships with every standard library since C++ 11.\n  Cons:  Failure to write handling code for failure means failures get silently dropped. This is disturbingly easy to do.\n Results in branchy code, which is slow \u0026ndash; though predictably so \u0026ndash; for embedded controller CPUs.\n Because the std::error_category instance used in construction comes from a magic static, the compiler inserts an atomic operation around every std::error_code construction (e.g. https://godbolt.org/z/oGaf4qe8a). This can impact optimisation on compilers with poor optimisation of atomics.\n The payload of type int is incredibly constraining sometimes, especially on 64-bit platforms. It would have been much better if it were intptr_t instead of int.\n The payload value of all bits zero has silent hard coded semantics which is incompatible with many C enumerations, which start from value zero. This can cause silent dropping of failures in a very hard to debug way.\n How comparisons between disparate code categories (i.e. mapping) is supposed to work is non-obvious, and even standard library maintainers and many members of WG21 have been confused by it in the past.\n  (Note that this long list of design caveats is what led to the proposed superseding of std::error_code with std::error, which you can use today in Outcome.Experimental.

Outcome specialises that trait for std::error_code and boost::system::error_code, hence they \u0026ldquo;just work\u0026rdquo;.\nIf no specialisation exists, trait::is_error_code_available\u0026lt;EC\u0026gt; is true if there exists some ADL discovered free function make_error_code(EC).\nThus, we can in fact use any custom EC type we like, including one carrying additional information, or payload. This payload can carry anything you like, and you can tell Outcome to do various things with that payload under various circumstances. For example:\n If the user tries to observe an unsuccessful result, throw a custom exception containing the cause of failure with accompanying context from the payload. If the user ever constructs an outcome from a payload carrying result, set the exception ptr in the constructed outcome to a custom exception containing the cause of the failure with accompanying context from the payload. Transmit a stack backtrace specifying the exact point at which failure occurred, symbolising that backtrace into human readable text at the moment of conversion into human readable text. Upon a namespace-localised result from library A being copy/moved into a namespace-localised result from C bindings library B, set the C errno if the error code and category map onto the errno domain.  There are many, many other options of course. This tutorial can only cover a reasonable subset. This section covers Example 1 above, throwing custom exceptions with payload upon observation of an unsuccessful result.\n"

This technique is very efficient.\nDownsides All failure paths written manually can be considered both an advantage and a disadvantage. Forgetting to put a failure handling if causes bugs.\nIf I need to substitute an error code returned by lower-level function with mine more appropriate at this level, the information about the original failure is gone.\nAlso, all possible error codes invented by different programmers in different third party libraries must fit into one int and not overlap with any other error code value. This is quite impossible and does not scale well.\nBecause errors are communicated through returned values, we cannot use function\u0026rsquo;s return type to return computed values.

High end CPU: Intel Skylake x64 Mid tier CPU: ARM Cortex A72 Low end CPUs: Intel Silvermont x64 and ARM Cortex A53  Why is implicit default construction disabled? How far away from the proposed std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; is Outcome\u0026rsquo;s checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;? Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t Outcome duplicate std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;\u0026rsquo;s design? Is Outcome riddled with undefined behaviour for const, const-containing and reference-containing types?  More detail     Is Outcome safe to use in extern APIs? Outcome is specifically designed for use in the public interfaces of multi-million line codebases. result\u0026rsquo;s layout is hard coded to:\nstruct trivially_copyable_result_layout { union { value_type value; error_type error; }; unsigned int flags; };  \u0026hellip; if both value_type and error_type are TriviallyCopyable, otherwise:\nstruct non_trivially_copyable_result_layout { value_type value; unsigned int flags; error_type error; };  This is C-compatible if value_type and error_type are C-compatible.  std::error_code is probably C-compatible, but its layout is not standardised (though there is a normative note in the standard about its layout). Hence Outcome cannot provide a C macro API for standard Outcome, but we can for Experimental Outcome.\nDoes Outcome implement over-alignment? Outcome propagates any over-alignment of the types you supply to it as according to the layout specified above. Therefore the ordinary alignment and padding rules for your compiler are used.\nDoes Outcome implement the no-fail, strong or basic exception guarantee? (You can read about the meaning of these guarantees at cppreference.com)\nIf for the following operations:\n Construction Assignment Swap  \u0026hellip; the corresponding operation in all of value_type, error_type (and exception_type for outcome) is noexcept(true), then result and outcome\u0026rsquo;s operation is noexcept(true). This propagates the no-fail exception guarantee of the underlying types. Otherwise the basic guarantee applies for all but Swap, under the same rules as for the struct layout type given above e.g. value would be constructed first, then the flags, then the error. If the error throws, value and status bits would be as if the failure had not occurred, same as for aborting the construction of any struct type.\nIt is recognised that these weak guarantees may be unsuitable for some people, so Outcome implements swap() with much stronger guarantees, as one can locally refine, without too much work, one\u0026rsquo;s own custom classes from result and outcome implementing stronger guarantees for construction and assignment using swap() as the primitive building block.\nThe core ADL discovered implementation of strong guarantee swap is strong_swap(bool \u0026amp;all_good, T \u0026amp;a, T \u0026amp;b) . This can be overloaded by third party code with custom strong guarantee swap implementations, same as for std::swap(). Because strong guarantee swap may fail when trying to restore input state during handling of failure to swap, the all_good boolean becomes false if restoration fails, at which point both results/outcomes get marked as tainted via has_lost_consistency() .\nIt is up to you to check this flag to see if known good state has been lost, as Outcome never does so on your behalf. The simple solution to avoiding having to deal with this situation is to always choose your value, error and exception types to have non-throwing move constructors and move assignments. This causes the strong swap implementation to no longer be used, as it is no longer required, and standard swap is used instead.\nDoes Outcome have a stable ABI and API? The layout changed for all trivially copyable types between Outcome v2.1 and v2.2, as union based storage was introduced. From v2.2 onwards, the layout is not expected to change again.\nIf v2.2 proves to be unchanging for 24 months, Outcome\u0026rsquo;s ABI and API will be formally fixed as the v2 interface and written into stone forever. Thereafter the ABI compliance checker will be run per-commit to ensure Outcome\u0026rsquo;s ABI and API remains stable. This is currently expected to occur in 2022.\nNote that the stable ABI and API guarantee will only apply to standalone Outcome, not to Boost.Outcome. Boost.Outcome has dependencies on other parts of Boost which are not stable across releases.\nNote also that the types you configure a result or outcome with also need to be ABI stable if result or outcome is to be ABI stable.\nCan I use result\u0026lt;T, EC\u0026gt; across DLL/shared object boundaries? A known problem with using Windows DLLs (and to smaller extent POSIX shared libraries) is that global objects may get duplicated: one instance in the executable and one in the DLL. This behaviour is not incorrect according to the C++ Standard, as the Standard does not recognize the existence of DLLs or shared libraries. Therefore, program designs that depend on globals having unique addresses may become compromised when used in a program using DLLs.\nNothing in Outcome depends on the addresses of globals, plus the guaranteed fixed data layout (see answer above) means that different versions of Outcome can be used in different DLLs, and it probably will work okay (it is still not advised that you do that as that is an ODR violation). However, one of the most likely candidate for EC \u0026ndash; std::error_code \u0026ndash; does depend on the addresses of globals for correct functioning.\nThe standard library is required to implement globally unique addresses for the standard library provided  std::error_category implementations e.g. std::system_category(). User defined error code categories may not have unique global addresses, and thus introduce misoperation.\nboost::system::error_code, since version 1.69 does offer an opt-in guarantee that it does not depend on the addresses of globals if the user defined error code category opts-in to the 64-bit comparison mechanism. This can be seen in the specification of error_category::operator== in Boost.System synopsis.\nAlternatively, the status_code in Experimental Outcome, due to its more modern design, does not suffer from any problems from being used in shared libraries in any configuration.\nWhy two types result\u0026lt;\u0026gt; and outcome\u0026lt;\u0026gt;, rather than just one? result is the simple, success OR failure type.\noutcome extends result with a third state to transport, conventionally (but not necessarily) some sort of \u0026ldquo;abort\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;exceptional\u0026rdquo; state which a function can return to indicate that not only did the operation fail, but it did so catastrophically i.e. please abort any attempt to retry the operation.\nA perfect alternative to using outcome is to throw a C++ exception for the abort code path, and indeed most programs ought to do exactly that instead of using outcome. However there are a number of use cases where choosing outcome shines:\n Where C++ exceptions or RTTI is not available, but the ability to fail catastrophically without terminating the program is important. Where deterministic behaviour is required even in the catastrophic failure situation. In unit test suites of code using Outcome it is extremely convenient to accumulate test failures into an outcome for later reporting. A similar convenience applies to RPC situations, where C++ exception throws need to be accumulated for reporting back to the initiating endpoint. Where a function is \u0026ldquo;dual use deterministic\u0026rdquo; i.e. it can be used deterministically, in which case one switches control flow based on .error(), or it can be used non-deterministically by throwing an exception perhaps carrying a custom payload.  How badly will including Outcome in my public interface affect compile times? The quick answer is that it depends on how much convenience you want.\nThe convenience header \u0026lt;result.hpp\u0026gt; is dependent on \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; or Boost.System, which unfortunately includes \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; and thus drags in quite a lot of other slow-to-parse stuff. If your public interface already includes \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;, then the impact of additionally including Outcome will be low. If you do not include \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;, unfortunately impact may be relatively quite high, depending on the total impact of your public interface files.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve been extremely careful to avoid ever including the most of the STL headers into your interfaces in order to maximise build performance, then \u0026lt;basic_result.hpp\u0026gt; can have as few dependencies as:\n \u0026lt;cstdint\u0026gt; \u0026lt;initializer_list\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iosfwd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;new\u0026gt; \u0026lt;type_traits\u0026gt; \u0026lt;cstdio\u0026gt; \u0026lt;cstdlib\u0026gt; \u0026lt;cassert\u0026gt;  These, apart from \u0026lt;iosfwd\u0026gt;, tend to be very low build time impact in most standard library implementations. If you include only \u0026lt;basic_result.hpp\u0026gt;, and manually configure basic_result\u0026lt;\u0026gt; by hand, compile time impact will be minimised.\n(See reference documentation for basic_result\u0026lt;T, E, NoValuePolicy\u0026gt; for more detail.\nIs Outcome suitable for fixed latency/predictable execution coding such as for high frequency trading or audio? Great care has been taken to ensure that Outcome never unexpectedly executes anything with unbounded execution times such as malloc(), dynamic_cast\u0026lt;\u0026gt;() or throw. Outcome works perfectly with C++ exceptions and RTTI globally disabled.\nOutcome\u0026rsquo;s entire design premise is that its users are happy to exchange a small, predictable constant overhead during successful code paths, in exchange for predictable failure code paths.\nIn contrast, table-based exception handling gives zero run time overhead for the successful code path, and completely unpredictable (and very expensive) overhead for failure code paths.\nFor code where predictability of execution, no matter the code path, is paramount, writing all your code to use Outcome is not a bad place to start. Obviously enough, do choose a non-throwing policy when configuring outcome or result such as all_narrow to guarantee that exceptions can never be thrown by Outcome (or use the convenience typedef for result, unchecked\u0026lt;T, E = varies\u0026gt; which uses policy::all_narrow).\nWhat kind of runtime performance impact will using Outcome in my code introduce? It is very hard to say anything definitive about performance impacts in codebases one has never seen. Each codebase is unique. However to come up with some form of measure, we timed traversing ten stack frames via each of the main mechanisms, including the \u0026ldquo;do nothing\u0026rdquo; (null) case.\nA stack frame is defined to be something called by the compiler whilst unwinding the stack between the point of return in the ultimate callee and the base caller, so for example ten stack allocated objects might be destructed, or ten levels of stack depth might be unwound. This is not a particularly realistic test, but it should at least give one an idea of the performance impact of returning Outcome\u0026rsquo;s result or outcome over say returning a plain integer, or throwing an exception.\nThe following figures are for Outcome v2.1.0 with GCC 7.4, clang 8.0 and Visual Studio 2017.9. Figures for newer Outcomes with newer compilers can be found at https://github.com/ned14/outcome/tree/develop/benchmark.\nHigh end CPU: Intel Skylake x64 This is a high end CPU with very significant ability to cache, predict, parallelise and execute out-of-order such that tight, repeated loops perform very well. It has a large μop cache able to wholly contain the test loop, meaning that these results are a best case performance.\n  Log graph comparing GCC 7.4, clang 8.0 and Visual Studio 2017.9 on x64, for exceptions-globally-disabled, ordinary and link-time-optimised build configurations.   As you can see, throwing and catching an exception is expensive on table-based exception handling implementations such as these, anywhere between 26,000 and 43,000 CPU cycles. And this is the hot path situation, this benchmark is a loop around hot cached code. If the tables are paged out onto storage, you are talking about millions of CPU cycles.\nSimple integer returns (i.e. do nothing null case) are always going to be the fastest as they do the least work, and that costs 80 to 90 CPU cycles on this Intel Skylake CPU.\nNote that returning a result\u0026lt;int, std::error_code\u0026gt; with a \u0026ldquo;success (error code)\u0026rdquo; is no more than 5% added runtime overhead over returning a naked int on GCC and clang. On MSVC it costs an extra 20% or so, mainly due to poor code optimisation in the VS2017.9 compiler. Note that \u0026ldquo;success (experimental status code)\u0026rdquo; optimises much better, and has almost no overhead over a naked int.\nReturning a result\u0026lt;int, std::error_code\u0026gt; with a \u0026ldquo;failure (error code)\u0026rdquo; is less than 5% runtime overhead over returning a success on GCC, clang and MSVC.\nYou might wonder what happens if type E has a non-trivial destructor, thus making the result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; have a non-trivial destructor? We tested E = std::exception_ptr and found less than a 5% overhead to E = std::error_code for returning success. Returning a failure was obviously much slower at anywhere between 300 and 1,100 CPU cycles, due to the dynamic memory allocation and free of the exception ptr, plus at least two atomic operations per stack frame, but that is still two orders of magnitude better than throwing and catching an exception.\nWe conclude that if failure is anything but extremely rare in your C++ codebase, using Outcome instead of throwing and catching exceptions ought to be quicker overall:\n Experimental Outcome is statistically indistinguishable from the null case on this high end CPU, for both returning success and failure, on all compilers. Standard Outcome is less than 5% worse than the null case for returning successes on GCC and clang, and less than 10% worse than the null case for returning failures on GCC and clang. Standard Outcome optimises poorly on VS2017.9, indeed markedly worse than on previous point releases, so let\u0026rsquo;s hope that Microsoft fix that soon. It currently has a less than 20% overhead on the null case.  Mid tier CPU: ARM Cortex A72 This is a four year old mid tier CPU used in many high end mobile phones and tablets of its day, with good ability to cache, predict, parallelise and execute out-of-order such that tight, repeated loops perform very well. It has a μop cache able to wholly contain the test loop, meaning that these results are a best case performance.\n  Log graph comparing GCC 7.3 and clang 7.3 on ARM64, for exceptions-globally-disabled, ordinary and link-time-optimised build configurations.   This ARM chip is a very consistent performer \u0026ndash; null case, success, or failure, all take almost exactly the same CPU cycles. Choosing Outcome, in any configuration, makes no difference to not using Outcome at all. Throwing and catching a C++ exception costs about 90,000 CPU cycles, whereas the null case/Outcome costs about 130 - 140 CPU cycles.\nThere is very little to say about this CPU, other than Outcome is zero overhead on it. The same applied to the ARM Cortex A15 incidentally, which I test cased extensively when deciding on the Outcome v2 design back after the first peer review. The v2 design was chosen partially because of such consistent performance on ARM.\nLow end CPUs: Intel Silvermont x64 and ARM Cortex A53 These are low end CPUs with a mostly or wholly in-order execution core. They have a small or no μop cache, meaning that the CPU must always decode the instruction stream. These results represent an execution environment more typical of CPUs two decades ago, back when table-based EH created a big performance win if you never threw an exception.\n  Log graph comparing GCC 7.3 and clang 7.3 on x64, for exceptions-globally-disabled, ordinary and link-time-optimised build configurations.     Log graph comparing GCC 7.3 and clang 7.3 on ARM64, for exceptions-globally-disabled, ordinary and link-time-optimised build configurations.  \nThe first thing to mention is that clang generates very high performance code for in-order cores, far better than GCC. It is said that this is due to a very large investment by Apple in clang/LLVM for their devices sustained over many years. In any case, if you\u0026rsquo;re targeting in-order CPUs, don\u0026rsquo;t use GCC if you can use clang instead!\nFor the null case, Silvermont and Cortex A53 are quite similar in terms of CPU clock cycles. Ditto for throwing and catching a C++ exception (approx 150,000 CPU cycles). However the Cortex A53 does far better with Outcome than Silvermont, a 15% versus 100% overhead for Standard Outcome, and a 4% versus 20% overhead for Experimental Outcome.\nMuch of this large difference is in fact due to calling convention differences. x64 permits up to 8 bytes to be returned from functions by CPU register. result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; consumes 24 bytes, so on x64 the compiler writes the return value to the stack. However ARM64 permits up to 64 bytes to be returned in registers, so result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; is returned via CPU registers on ARM64.\nOn higher end CPUs, memory is read and written in cache lines (32 or 64 bytes), and reads and writes are coalesced and batched together by the out-of-order execution core. On these low end CPUs, memory is read and written sequentially per assembler instruction, so only one load or one store to L1 cache can occur at a time. This makes writing the stack particularly slow on in-order CPUs. Memory operations which \u0026ldquo;disappear\u0026rdquo; on higher end CPUs take considerable time on low end CPUs. This particularly punishes Silvermont in a way which does not punish the Cortex A53, because of having to write multiple values to the stack to create the 24 byte object to be returned.\nThe conclusion to take away from this is that if you are targeting a low end CPU, table-based EH still delivers significant performance improvements for the success code path. Unless determinism in failure is critically important, you should not use Outcome on in-order execution CPUs.\nWhy is implicit default construction disabled? This was one of the more interesting points of discussion during the peer review of Outcome v1. v1 had a formal empty state. This came with many advantages, but it was not felt to be STL idiomatic as std::optional\u0026lt;result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026gt; is what was meant, so v2 has eliminated any legal possibility of being empty.\nThe expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; proposal of that time (May 2017) did permit default construction if its T type allowed default construction. This was specifically done to make expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; more useful in STL containers as one can say resize a vector without having to supply an expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; instance to fill the new items with. However there was some unease with that design choice, because it may cause programmers to use some type T whose default constructed state is overloaded with additional meaning, typically \u0026ldquo;to be filled\u0026rdquo; i.e. a de facto empty state via choosing a magic value.\nFor the v2 redesign, the various arguments during the v1 review were considered. Unlike expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; which is intended to be a general purpose Either monad vocabulary type, Outcome\u0026rsquo;s types are meant primarily for returning success or failure from functions. The API should therefore encourage the programmer to not overload the successful type with additional meaning of \u0026ldquo;to be filled\u0026rdquo; e.g. result\u0026lt;std::optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026gt;. The decision was therefore taken to disable implicit default construction, but still permit explicit default construction by making the programmer spell out their intention with extra typing.\nTo therefore explicitly default construct a result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; or outcome\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;, use one of these forms as is the most appropriate for the use case:\n Construct with just in_place_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; e.g. result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(in_place_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;). Construct via success() e.g. outcome\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(success()). Construct from a void form e.g. result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(result\u0026lt;void\u0026gt;(in_place_type\u0026lt;void\u0026gt;)).  How far away from the proposed std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; is Outcome\u0026rsquo;s checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;? Not far, in fact after the first Boost.Outcome peer review in May 2017, Expected moved much closer to Outcome, and Outcome deliberately provides checked\u0026lt;T, E = varies\u0026gt; as a semantic equivalent.\nHere are the remaining differences which represent the divergence of consensus opinion between the Boost peer review and WG21 on the proper design for this object:\n checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; has no default constructor. Expected has a default constructor if T has a default constructor. checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; uses the same constructor design as std::variant\u0026lt;...\u0026gt;. Expected uses the constructor design of std::optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;. checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; cannot be modified after construction except by assignment. Expected provides an .emplace() modifier. checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; permits implicit construction from both T and E when unambiguous. Expected permits implicit construction from T alone. checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; does not permit T and E to be the same, and becomes annoying to use if they are constructible into one another (implicit construction self-disables). Expected permits T and E to be the same. checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; throws bad_result_access_with\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; instead of Expected\u0026rsquo;s bad_expected_access\u0026lt;E\u0026gt;. checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; models std::variant\u0026lt;...\u0026gt;. Expected models std::optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;. Thus:  checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; does not provide operator*() nor operator-\u0026gt; checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; .error() is wide (i.e. throws on no-value) like .value(). Expected\u0026rsquo;s .error() is narrow (UB on no-error). [checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; provides .assume_value() and .assume_error() for narrow (UB causing) observers].  checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; uses success\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; and failure\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; type sugars for disambiguation. Expected uses unexpected\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; only. checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; does not implement (prone to unintended misoperation) comparison operators which permit implicit conversion e.g. checked\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; == T will fail to compile. Instead write unambiguous code e.g. checked\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; == success(T) or checked\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; == failure(T). checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; defaults E to std::error_code or boost::system::error_code. Expected does not default E.  In fact, the two are sufficiently close in design that a highly conforming expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; can be implemented by wrapping up checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; with the differing functionality:\n/* Here is a fairly conforming implementation of P0323R3 `expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;` using `checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;`. It passes the reference test suite for P0323R3 at https://github.com/viboes/std-make/blob/master/test/expected/expected_pass.cpp with modifications only to move the test much closer to the P0323R3 Expected, as the reference test suite is for a much older proposed Expected. Known differences from P0323R3 in this implementation: - `T` and `E` cannot be the same type. - `E` must be default constructible. - No variant storage is implemented (note the Expected proposal does not actually require this). */ namespace detail { template \u0026lt;classT, classE\u0026gt; using expected_result = OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::checked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;; template \u0026lt;classT, classE\u0026gt; struct enable_default_constructor : public expected_result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; { using base = expected_result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;; using base::base; constexpr enable_default_constructor() : base{OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::in_place_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;} { } }; template \u0026lt;classT, classE\u0026gt; using select_expected_base = std::conditional_t\u0026lt;std::is_default_constructible\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;::value, enable_default_constructor\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;, expected_result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;; } template \u0026lt;classT, classE\u0026gt; classexpected : public detail::select_expected_base\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; { static_assert(!std::is_same\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;::value, \u0026#34;T and E cannot be the same in this expected implementation\u0026#34;); using base = detail::select_expected_base\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;; public: // Inherit base\u0026#39;s constructors  using base::base; expected() = default; // Expected takes in_place not in_place_type  template \u0026lt;class...

There are a number of reasons:\n Outcome is not aimed at the same audience as Expected. We target developers and users who would be happy to use Boost. Expected targets the standard library user.\n Outcome believes that the monadic use case isn\u0026rsquo;t as important as Expected does. Specifically, we think that 99% of use of Expected in the real world will be to return failure from functions, and not as some sort of enhanced or \u0026ldquo;rich\u0026rdquo; Optional. Outcome therefore models a subset of Variant, whereas Expected models an extended Optional.\n Outcome believes that if you are thinking about using something like Outcome, then for you writing failure code will be in the same proportion as writing success code, and thus in Outcome writing for failure is exactly the same as writing for success. Expected assumes that success will be more common than failure, and makes you type more when writing for failure.\n Outcome goes to considerable effort to help the end user type fewer characters during use. This results in tighter, less verbose, more succinct code. The cost of this is a steeper learning curve and more complex mental model than when programming with Expected.\n Outcome has facilities to make easier interoperation between multiple third party libraries each using incommensurate Outcome (or Expected) configurations. Expected does not do any of this, but subsequent WG21 papers do propose various interoperation mechanisms, one of which Outcome implements so code using Expected will seamlessly interoperate with code using Outcome.\n Outcome was designed with the benefit of hindsight after Optional and Expected, where how those do implicit conversions have been found to be prone to writing unintentionally buggy code. Outcome simultaneously permits more implicit conversions for ease of use and convenience, where those are unambigiously safe, and prevents other implicit conversions which the Boost peer review reported as dangerous.\n  Is Outcome riddled with undefined behaviour for const, const-containing and reference-containing types? The short answer is not any more in C++ 20 and after, thanks to changes made to C++ 20 at the Belfast WG21 meeting in November 2019.\nThe longer answer is that before C++ 20, use of placement new on types containing const member types where the resulting pointer was thrown away is undefined behaviour. As of the resolution of a national body comment, this is no longer the case, and now Outcome is free of this particular UB for C++ 20 onwards.\nThis still affects C++ before 20, though no major compiler is affected. Still, if you wish to avoid UB, don\u0026rsquo;t use const types within Outcome types (or any optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;, or vector\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; or any STL container type for that matter).\nMore detail Before the C++ 14 standard, placement new into storage which used to contain a const type was straight out always undefined behaviour, period. Thus all use of placement new within a result\u0026lt;const_containing_type\u0026gt;, or indeed an optional\u0026lt;const_containing_type\u0026gt;, is always undefined behaviour before C++ 14. From [basic.life] for the C++ 11 standard:\n Creating a new object at the storage location that a const object with static, thread, or automatic storage duration occupies or, at the storage location that such a const object used to occupy before its lifetime ended results in undefined behavior.\n This being excessively restrictive, from C++ 14 onwards, [basic_life] now states:\n If, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the object occupied is reused or released, a new object is created at the storage location which the original object occupied, a pointer that pointed to the original object, a reference that referred to the original object, or the name of the original object will automatically refer to the new object and, once the lifetime of the new object has started, can be used to manipulate the new object, if:\n— the storage for the new object exactly overlays the storage location which the original object occupied, and\n— the new object is of the same type as the original object (ignoring the top-level cv-qualifiers), and\n— the type of the original object is not const-qualified, and, if a class type, does not contain any non-static data member whose type is const-qualified or a reference type, and\n— neither the original object nor the new object is a potentially-overlapping subobject\n Leaving aside my personal objections to giving placement new of non-const non-reference types magical pointer renaming powers, the upshot is that if you want defined behaviour for placement new of types containing const types or references, you must store the pointer returned by placement new, and use that pointer for all further reference to the newly created object. This obviously adds eight bytes of storage to a result\u0026lt;const_containing_type\u0026gt;, which is highly undesirable given all the care and attention paid to keeping it small. The alternative is to use  std::launder , which was added in C++ 17, to \u0026lsquo;launder\u0026rsquo; the storage into which we placement new before each and every use of that storage. This forces the compiler to reload the object stored by placement new on every occasion, and not assume it can be constant propagated, which impacts codegen quality.\nAs mentioned above, this issue (in so far as it applies to types containing user supplied T which might be const) has been resolved as of C++ 20 onwards, and it is extremely unlikely that any C++ compiler will act on any UB here in C++ 17 or 14 given how much of STL containers would break.\n"

If it can, an errored Result with the equivalent error code would be returned.\n If your Coroutine were returning an outcome\u0026lt;T, std::error_code, std::exception_ptr\u0026gt;, an Errored Outcome is chosen preferentially to an Excepted Outcome.\n If your Coroutine were returning an experimental::status_result\u0026lt;T, system_code\u0026gt;, because Experimental SG14 system_code can transport error codes or exception ptrs (or indeed std::error_code\u0026rsquo;s), an errored Result is returned.\n  "

To prevent the confounding of the C preprocessor by commas in template specifications causing more than eight arguments appearing to the C preprocessor, you should consider wrapping the second argument in brackets.\nIf you are within a C++ Coroutine, you ought to use OUTCOME_CO_TRYV(expr)/OUTCOME_CO_TRY(expr) instead.\n Compiler-specific extension: OUTCOME_TRYX This macro makes use of a proprietary extension in GCC and clang, and is not portable. The macro is not made available on unsupported compilers, so you can test for its presence using #ifdef OUTCOME_TRYX.\n GCC and Clang provide an extension to C++ known as statement expressions. These make it possible to use a more convenient macro: OUTCOME_TRYX, which is an expression. With the above macro, the above declaration of variable i can be rewritten to:\nint i = OUTCOME_TRYX (BigInt::fromString(text));  This has an advantage that you can use it any place where you can put an expression, e.g., in \u0026ldquo;simple initialization\u0026rdquo;:\nif (int i = OUTCOME_TRYX(BigInt::fromString(text))) use_a_non_zero_int(i);  or in as a subexpression of a bigger full expression:\nint ans = OUTCOME_TRYX(BigInt::fromString(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;)) + OUTCOME_TRYX(BigInt::fromString(\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;));  There is also an OUTCOME_CO_TRYX(expr) if you are inside a C++ Coroutine.\n"

	"content": " std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; came originally from an experimental monadic and generic programming library outside of Boost written by Boost and WG21 developers around 2013. Before Outcome v1, I deployed the then Expected into a large codebase and I was dismayed with the results, especially on build times. You can read here how those experiences led me to develop Outcome v1.\nstd::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; is a constrained variant type with a strong preference for the successful type T which it models like a std::optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;. If, however, there is no T value then it supplies an \u0026lsquo;unexpected\u0026rsquo; E value instead. std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; was standardised in the C++ 23 standard.\nOutcome\u0026rsquo;s Result type can be configured to act just like Expected if you want that, however ultimately Outcome\u0026rsquo;s Result doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve the same problem as Expected, plus Outcome models std::variant\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; rather than std::optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; which we think much superior for many use cases, which to summarise:\n If you are parsing input which may rarely contain unexpected values, Expected is the right choice here.\n If you want an alternative to C++ exception handling i.e. a generalised whole-program error handling framework, Expected is an inferior choice to alternatives.\n  Outcome recognises Expected-like types and will construct from them, which aids interoperability.\nPros:  Predictable runtime overhead on the happy path.\n Predictable runtime overhead on the sad path.\n Very little codegen bloat added to binaries (though there is a fixed absolute overhead for support libraries).\n Variant storage means storage overhead is minimal, except when either T or E has a throwing move constructor which typically causes storage blowup.\n Works well in all configurations of C++, including C++ exceptions and RTTI globally disabled.\n Works well on all niche architectures, such as HPC, GPUs, DSPs and microcontrollers.\n Ships with every standard library since C++ 23.\n  Cons:  Success-orientated syntax makes doing anything with the E type is awkward and clunky.\n Results in branchy code, which is slow \u0026ndash; though predictably so \u0026ndash; for embedded controller CPUs.\n Failure to examine an Expected generates a compiler diagnostic, but failure to handle both failure and success does not. This can mean failures or successes get accidentally dropped.\n Lack of a try operator makes use tedious and verbose.\n Variant storage does have an outsize impact on build times in the same way widespread use of std::variant has. This is because implementing exception guarantees during copies and moves of non-trivially-copyable types in union storage involves a lot of work for the compiler on every use of copy and move.\n  "

	"title": "v2.2 major changes",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Major changes in v2.2 over v2.1 are listed here.\n A new trait is_move_bitcopying\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; is added, which opts types into a library-based emulation of P1029 move = bitcopies. Experimental std::error is opted in by default. If this trait is true for your T or E type, Outcome will track moved-from status for your type, and will only call your type\u0026rsquo;s destructor if it was not moved from. If your compiler\u0026rsquo;s optimiser is sufficiently able to fold code, this improves codegen quality for Experimental Outcome very considerably, approaching the same gains as P1029 types would have. Note that the empirical performance difference will likely be nil, but the codegen does look much more elegant.\n If for basic_result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; both T and E are trivially copyable, union-based rather than struct-based storage will be used. This significantly improves performance in synthetic benchmarks which do nothing in deep call stacks of function calls except create and return result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;, and makes Outcome return competitive results to alternative error handling choices, improving comparative optics. It is not expected that the performance difference will be detectable empirically in real world code. It is expected that the build time impact of union storage won\u0026rsquo;t be noticeable, as union storage for trivially copyable types is much easier than for non-TC types.\nNote that storage remains struct-based if either T or E is neither trivially copyable nor for which trait is_move_bitcopying\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; is true. This is because union-based storage for complex types has significant build time impact, as anyone who has deployed std::variant or std::expected into globally visible public APIs will have noticed.\n The compile time requirement for E types to have a default constructor is removed.\n OUTCOME_TRY(var, expr) no longer always declares var as auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;var, but simply uses it as is. This allows TRY to initialise or assign. You can use the macro OUTCOME21_TRY if you want the pre-Outcome v2.2 behaviour. You may find the regular expression _TRY\\(([^(]*?),(.*?)\\); =\u0026gt; _TRY(auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\\1,\\2); of use to you when upgrading code.\n OUTCOME_TRY now declares its internal uniquely named temporary variable which holds the result of the expression as auto unique = expr instead of auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;unique = expr. This will cause TRY of result\u0026lt;UncopyableAndImmovable\u0026gt; and outcome\u0026lt;UncopyableAndImmovable\u0026gt; to fail to compile, whereas previously they did compile. Another big change in semantic is that TRY now will \u0026lsquo;consume\u0026rsquo; values moved into it, whereas previously it did not/ The reason for this change was that the previous behaviour produced undefined behaviour in various corner use cases, particulary in generic code. You can tell TRY to use references instead of values for its uniquely named temporary using a special syntax.\n OUTCOME_TRY now propagates the value from spare_storage(const basic_result|basic_outcome *) noexcept of the input Result/Outcome into any failure_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; returned by TRY. Result/Outcome now sets its spare storage value from any success_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; or failure_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; from which it is constructed. This is a breaking change, as spare storage values were not propagated beforehand. However this change means that any stack backtrace identifier captured by a failed result construction hook is now fully propagated from failure point up through all TRY operations to the code which handles the failure.\n The ADL discovered event hooks have been replaced with policy-specified event hooks instead. This is due to brittleness (where hooks would quietly self-disable if somebody changed something), compiler bugs (a difference in compiler settings causes the wrong hooks, or some but not all hooks, to get discovered), and end user difficulty in using them at all. The policy-specified event hooks can be told to default to ADL discovered hooks for backwards compatibility: set OUTCOME_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPPORT_FOR to less than 220 to enable emulation.\n  "

Here we specialise the converter for value_or_error conversions from httplib::result\u0026lt;U\u0026gt; to app::outcome\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; i.e. from our third party HTTP library\u0026rsquo;s error type into our application\u0026rsquo;s outcome type (which is unique to our application, as we hard code an app-local error type).\nThe second thing to note is that you need to set enable_result_inputs and enable_outcome_inputs appropriately, otherwise result and outcome inputs will not be matched by this converter1. In this converter, we really do wish to convert other result and outcome inputs, so we mark these booleans as true.\nThe third thing to note is the requirements on operator(). If the requirements are not met, the value_or_error converting constructor in basic_result and basic_outcome disables. Note the requirement that the decayed operator() input X matches httplib::result\u0026lt;U\u0026gt;, and that T is constructible from U. This means that the explicit basic_result(concepts::value_or_error\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; \u0026amp;\u0026amp;) and explicit basic_outcome(concepts::value_or_error\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; \u0026amp;\u0026amp;) constructors are available if, and only if, the input type is a httplib::result\u0026lt;U\u0026gt;, and the result\u0026rsquo;s value type is constructible from the input\u0026rsquo;s value type.\nIf operator() is available, it naturally converts a httplib::result\u0026lt;U\u0026gt; into an app::outcome\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; by either forwarding any success as-is, or calling app::make_httplib_exception() to type erase the httplib::failure into an app::httplib_error.\n Here we refer to result and outcome as defined by this specific Outcome library. If result or outcome from another Outcome implementation is seen, those always must get parsed via the ValueOrError matching conversion framework. [return]   "

Firstly let us look at the function which synthesises the exception ptr:\nnamespace error_code_extended { // Synthesise a custom exception_ptr from the TLS slot and write it into the outcome  template \u0026lt;classR\u0026gt; inline void poke_exception(outcome\u0026lt;R\u0026gt; *o) { if(o-\u0026gt;has_error()) { extended_error_info *eei = mythreadlocaldata().get(OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::hooks::spare_storage(o)); if(eei != nullptr) { // Make a custom string for the exception  std::string str(o-\u0026gt;error().message()); str.append(\u0026#34; [\u0026#34;); struct unsymbols // RAII cleaner for symbols  { char **_{nullptr}; ~unsymbols() { ::free(_); } } symbols{::backtrace_symbols(eei-\u0026gt;backtrace.data(), eei-\u0026gt;items)}; if(symbols._ != nullptr) { for(size_t n = 0; n \u0026lt; eei-\u0026gt;items; n++) { if(n \u0026gt; 0) { str.append(\u0026#34;; \u0026#34;); } str.append(symbols._[n]); } } str.append(\u0026#34;]\u0026#34;); // Override the payload/exception member in the outcome with our synthesised exception ptr  OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::hooks::override_outcome_exception(o, std::make_exception_ptr(std::runtime_error(str))); } } } } View this code on Github If the localised outcome being constructed is errored, try fetching the TLS slot for the unique 16-bit value in its spare storage. If that is valid, symbolise the stack backtrace into a string and make an exception ptr with a runtime error with that string. Finally, override the payload/exception member in our just-copy-constructed localised outcome with the new exception ptr.\n As the reference documentation for void override_outcome_exception(basic_outcome\u0026lt;T, EC, EP, NoValuePolicy\u0026gt; *, U \u0026amp;\u0026amp;) noexcept points out, you almost certainly never want to use this function if there is any other alternative. It is worth explaining what is meant by this.\nIn this section, we always synthesise an exception ptr from the stored state and error code at the exact point of transition from result based APIs to outcome based APIs. This is acceptable only because we know that our code enforces that discipline.\nIf one were designing a library facility, one could not assume such discipline in the library user. One would probably be better off making the exception ptr synthesis lazy via a custom no-value policy which generates the stacktrace-containing error message only on demand e.g. .exception() observation, or a .value() observation where no value is available.\nSuch a design is however more indeterminate than the design presented in this section, because the indeterminacy is less predictable than in this design. Ultimately which strategy you adopt depends on how important absolute determinism is to your Outcome-based application.\n"

You can read here how those experiences led me to develop Outcome v1. Outcome comes in both standalone and Boost editions, and its current design was completed in 2018.\nOutcome\u0026rsquo;s core is two workhorse types and a macro:\n basic_result\u0026lt;T, E, NoValuePolicy\u0026gt;  basic_outcome\u0026lt;T, EC, EP, NoValuePolicy\u0026gt;  OUTCOME_TRY(var, expr)   These three core items are then mixed into a veritable cornucopia of convenience typedefs and variations to support a wide range of use cases, including in C++ coroutines, plus there is extensive plumbing and customisation points for deciding how incompatible types ought to interact, or being notified of lifecycle events (e.g. capture a stack backtrace if a result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; is constructed with an error).\nOutcome perfectly propagates constexpr, triviality and noexcept-ness of each individual operation of the types you configure it with.

It is capable of \u0026lsquo;true moves\u0026rsquo; for types which declare themselves \u0026lsquo;move bitcopying compatible\u0026rsquo; i.e. destructor calls on moved-from values are elided. \u0026lsquo;True moves\u0026rsquo; can have a game changing performance gain on types with virtual destructors.\nOutcome takes a lot of care to have the least possible impact on build times, and it guarantees that a binary built with it will have stable ABI so it is safe to use in really large C++ codebases (standalone edition only). For interoperation with other languages, it guarantees that C code can work with Outcome data types, and it provides a C macro API header file to help with that.\nOutcome recognises Expected-like types and will construct from them, which aids interoperability. A simplified Result type is proposed for standardisation as std::result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; where the E type is hard coded to a proposed std::error. This proposed standardisation has been deployed on billions of devices at the time of writing, and you can use it today via Experimental.Outcome, the reference implementation.\nPros:  Predictable runtime overhead on the happy path.\n Predictable runtime overhead on the sad path.\n Very little codegen bloat added to binaries (though there is a fixed absolute overhead for support libraries if you use Outcome\u0026rsquo;s bundled error types).\n Neither success nor failure is prioritised during use \u0026ndash; types will implicitly construct from both T and E if it is unambiguous, so no clunky added markup needed to return an E.\n Sad path control flow is required to be explicitly specified in every situation. This significantly reduces the number of sad control flow paths in a code base, making it much easier to test all of them. It also means that sad paths get audited and checked during code reviews.\n Macro TRY operator feels a bit unnatural to use, but is a god send to saving visual code clutter when all you want to say is \u0026lsquo;handle this failure by asking my caller to handle it\u0026rsquo;. It also works with non-Outcome types, and has its own suite of customisation points for third party extension.\n Works well in all configurations of C++, including C++ exceptions and RTTI globally disabled.\n Works well on all niche architectures, such as HPC, GPUs, DSPs and microcontrollers, and does not dynamically allocate memory.\n  Cons:  Sad path control flow is required to be explicitly specified in every situation. For code where failure is extremely unlikely, or is not important because it always results in aborting the current operation, the added visual code clutter is unhelpful.\n Results in branchy code, which is slow \u0026ndash; though predictably so \u0026ndash; for embedded controller CPUs.\n Failure to examine an Outcome type generates a compiler diagnostic, but failure to handle both failure and success does not. This can mean failures or successes get accidentally dropped.\n To prevent variant storage having an outsize impact on build times in the same way widespread use of std::variant has, Outcome only implements union storage when both T and E are trivially copyable or move bitcopying. Otherwise struct storage is used, which means Outcome\u0026rsquo;s types are larger than Expected\u0026rsquo;s. This is because implementing exception guarantees during copies and moves of non-trivially-copyable types in union storage involves a lot of work for the compiler on every use of copy and move, so by using struct storage Outcome reduces build time impact from copies and moves significantly.\nNote that one of the major uses of Outcome types is as the return type from a function, in which case copy elision would happen in C++ 14 and is guaranteed from C++ 17 onwards. This means that the larger footprint of struct storage typically has much less impact in optimised code than might be the case if you store these types inside other types.\n  "

Because it is an errored status code, it will always represent a failure.\nYou can absolutely choose an E type which is non-erased e.g. posix_code directly. You can also choose an E type which is not contract guaranteed to be a failure, though your users may find that surprising.\nWhether to choose typed status codes versus the erased status codes depends on your use cases. Outcome replicates faithfully the implicit and explicit conversion semantics of its underlying types, so you can mix results and outcomes of \u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt; types exactly as you can the \u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt; types themselves e.g. typed forms will implicitly convert into erased forms if the source type is trivially copyable or move relocating. This means that you can return a generic_code from a function returning a system_code or error, and it\u0026rsquo;ll work exactly as you\u0026rsquo;d expect (implicit conversion).\nAs status_code\u0026lt;erased\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026gt; is move-only, so is any status_result or status_outcome. For some reason this surprises a lot of people, and they tend to react by not using the erased form because it seems \u0026ldquo;difficult\u0026rdquo;.\n It is actually, in fact, a wise discipline to follow to make all functions return move-only types if you care about determinism and performance. Whilst C++ 17 onwards does much to have the compiler avoid copying of identical function return values thanks to guaranteed copy elision, when a chain of functions return different types, if the programmer forgets to scatter std::move() appropriately, copies rather than moves tend to occur in non-obvious ways. No doubt future C++ standards will improve on the automatic use of moves instead of copies where possible, but until then making all your result and outcome types move-only is an excellent discipline.\nNote that move-only result and outcome capable code (i.e. your project is in Experimental Outcome configuration) usually compiles fine when result and outcome are copyable (i.e. your project is in Standard Outcome configuration), albeit sometimes with a few compiler warnings about unnecessary use of std::move().\n"

	"content": "Type std::error_code has been designed to be sufficiently small and trivial to be cheaply passed around, and at the same time be able to store sufficient information to represent any error situation from any library/sub-system in the world without a clash. Its representation is basically:\nclasserror_code { error_category* domain; // domain from which the error originates  int value; // numeric value of error within the domain };  Here, domain indicates the library from which the error originates. It is a pointer to a global object representing a given library/domain. Different libraries will be represented by different pointers to different globals. Each domain is expected to be represented by a global object derived from std::error_category. The uniqueness of the domain pointer value is guaranteed by the uniqueness of addresses of different global objects.\nNow, value represents a numeric value of a particular error situation within the domain. Thus, different domains can use the same numeric value 1 to indicate different error situations, but two std::error_code objects will be different because the pointers representing domains will be different.\nstd::error_code comes with additional tools: a facility for defining custom domains with their set of error codes, and a facility for building predicates that allow classifying errors.\nOnce created and passed around (either inside a thrown exception or returned from functions by value) there is never a need to change the value of error_code object at any level. But at different levels one can use different predicates for classifying error situations appropriately to the program layer.\nWhen a new library needs to represent its own set of error situations in an error_code it first has to declare the list of numeric value as an enumeration:\nenum classConvertErrc { StringTooLong = 1, // 0 should not represent an error  EmptyString = 2, IllegalChar = 3, };  Then it has to put some boiler-plate code to plug the new enumeration into the std::error_code system. Then, it can use the enum as an error_code:\nstd::error_code ec = ConvertErrc::EmptyString; assert(ec == ConvertErrc::EmptyString);  Member value is mapped directly from the numeric value in the enumeration, and member domain is mapped from the type of the enumeration. Thus, this is a form of type erasure, but one that does allow type std::error_code to be trivial and standard-layout.\n"

The implication is that one cannot avoid throwing C++ exceptions to abort a construction.\nAs with most things in C++, one can achieve zero-exception-throw object construction using a lot of extra typing of boilerplate, and a little bit of simple C++ metaprogramming. This section shows you how to implement these for those who are absolutely adverse to ever throwing an exception, or cannot because C++ exceptions have been globally disabled.\nThe technique described here is not suitable for non-copyable and non-movable types. There is also an assumption that moving your type is cheap.\n"

The ident must be any identifier fragment unique in this translation unit. It is used to uniquely identify this status code type in other macros. CXX_STATUS_CODE(ident) A reference to a previously declared status code type with unique ident.

T is available at the member variable .value, and E is available at the member variable .error. CXX_RESULT_STATUS_CODE(ident) A reference to a previously declared result type with unique ident.  There is a high likelihood that C++ functions regularly called by C code will return their failures either in erased system_code or in posix_code (i.e. errno code domain). Via querying the returned value using CXX_RESULT_ERROR_IS_ERRNO(r), one can determine if the returned code is in the errno code domain, and thus can be fed to strerror() and so on.

If the copy and/or move constructors of T, EC and EP are noexcept, then so will be outcome\u0026rsquo;s copy and/or move constructor. Thus if poke_exception() throws, instant program termination would occur, which is bad.\nWe avoid that problem in this case by wrapping poke_exception() in a try...catch which throws away any exceptions thrown.

The deepest method is simply to inherit from basic_result or basic_outcome, and override member functions, for which you will need to study the source code as that form of customisation is out of scope for this tutorial.\nAnother option is to supply a custom NoValuePolicy (see preceding section). From Outcome v2.2 onwards, intercepting construction, copies and moves requires a custom NoValuePolicy.\nBefore Outcome v2.2, there was an ADL discovered event hook mechanism for intercepting construction, copies and moves (it was found to be brittle, error prone and surprising in empirical use, which is why it was replaced). The ADL discovered event hooks still function in Outcome v2.2 and later if OUTCOME_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPPORT_FOR is set to less than 220 to enable emulation.\nYou will note that the naming is simply one of hook_* =\u0026gt; on_*, the parameters remain identical.

One effectively has constructed a \u0026ldquo;lazy indeterminism\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;just-in-time indeterminism\u0026rdquo; mechanism for handling failure, but with all the rich information of throwing C++ exceptions.\n"

It was felt important during Outcome\u0026rsquo;s design that value_or_error conversions never be implicit, as they almost always represent a transition across an ABI or semantic boundary. They are also usually non-trivial to implement and compile, and it was felt important that the programmer ought to always mark the semantic boundary transition at the point of every use, as considerable amounts of code may execute.\nHow the end user chooses to mark up their code is up to them, however above we use a simple ext() function to mark up that the function being called is external to the application. This ticks our box of requiring the documentation, at the point of use, of every transition in failure handling boundaries.\nNote that we are able to use TRY as normal throughout this function. Everything \u0026ldquo;just works\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd most especially note that we never, at any stage, needed to modify the source code of httplib, tidylib nor filelib, nor inject custom things into their namespaces.

	"content": " As much as Outcome originated in a negative reaction to the then originally proposed std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;, LEAF originated in a negative reaction to Outcome. Some of the perceived issues with Outcome were (LEAF\u0026rsquo;s own rendition of this can be viewed here):\n Outcome based code is visually cluttered, as both happy and sad paths appear in code.\n Outcome based code generates branchy code at runtime, which impacts low end CPUs and first time code execution.\n Outcome\u0026rsquo;s Result type encodes the type of the error in the function signature, which could be considered as more brittle and problematic for large scale code refactoring1.\n Outcome is more strongly opinionated about being the ultimate error handling framework in a program (i.e. all third party custom error handling is assumed to flow into Outcome via customisation point adapters), whereas LEAF is less strongly opinionated, and yet provides equivalent functionality.\n  LEAF therefore looks more like standard C++ exception handling, but without the non-deterministic sad path at the cost of a slight impact on happy path runtime performance. LEAF\u0026rsquo;s current design was completed in 2020.\nIf you need an error handling framework which has predictable sad path overhead unlike C++ exceptions, but you otherwise want similar syntax and use experience to C++ exceptions, LEAF is a very solid choice.\nPros:  Very low runtime overhead on the happy path.\n Very low runtime overhead on the sad path.\n Does not cause branchy code to the same extent as Outcome, and the sad path is deterministic unlike with C++ exceptions.\n Very little codegen bloat added to binaries (though there is a fixed absolute overhead for support libraries, most of which can be compiled out using a macro if desired).\n Unlike with any of the preceding options, failures nor successes cannot get unintentionally dropped. This is the same strength of guarantee as with C++ exceptions.\n Works well in most configurations of C++, including C++ exceptions and RTTI globally disabled. Does not dynamically allocate memory.\n  Cons:  Requires out of band storage for state e.g. thread local storage, or a global synchronised ring buffer2.\n If thread local storage is chosen as the out of band storage, transporting LEAF state across threads requires manual intervention.\n If a global ring buffer is chosen as the out of band storage, thread synchronisation with global state is required and the ring buffer can wrap which drops state.\n  Thread local storage can be problematic or even a showstopper in many niche architectures such as HPC, GPUs, DSPs and microcontrollers. Global synchronised state can introduce an unacceptable performance impact on those architectures.\n Current compilers at the time of writing do not react well to use of thread local storage, it would seem that elision of code generation is inhibited if thread local state gets touched due to pessimistic assumptions about escape analysis. Given that this impacts all of C and C++ due to the same problem with errno, it is hoped that future compilers will improve this. Until then, any code which touches thread local storage or magic statics3 will not optimise as well as code which does neither.\n   In Outcome, it is strongly recommended that one chooses a single universal error type for all public APIs such as std::error_code or error from Experimental.Outcome, so if the programmer is disciplined then the function signature does not expose internal error types. Such single universal error types type erase the original error object, but still allow the original error object to be inspected. This avoids \u0026lsquo;exception specifications\u0026rsquo; which are widely known to not scale well. [return] A global synchronised ring buffer implementation does not ship with LEAF, however LEAF exposes customisation points for a bespoke thread local storage implementation which makes implementing one very straightforward. [return] std::error_code construction touches a magic static or calls an extern function, and therefore Outcome when combined with std::error_code also sees a codegen pessimisation. Experimental Outcome\u0026rsquo;s error fixes this historical oversight. [return]   "

As usually you\u0026rsquo;d need to define a print routine for any custom error code you\u0026rsquo;d write anyway, there is actually very little extra boilerplate here. If you implement the default_error_condition() override, you can allow code exclusively written to understand std::errc alone to examine your custom error code domain for equivalence to the standard error conditions, AND without being recompiled.  This documentation recommends that when you define your custom enum for representing error_codes, you should always make sure that value 0 never represents an actual error: it should either represent a success or should not be provided at all. If you only intend to use your enum inside result\u0026lt;\u0026gt; or outcome\u0026lt;\u0026gt; you can just start your enumerations from 1. If you intend to also return std::error_code directly from functions, you should probably define value 0 as success, so that you are able to inform about function\u0026rsquo;s success by returning MyEnum::Success. This is because error_code\u0026rsquo;s contextual conversion to bool (which some people use to check if there was an error or not) only checks for the numeric value of the error code (without looking at error domain (category)).\n [1]: The only documentation I\u0026rsquo;m aware of is the quite old guide by Chris Kohlhoff, founder of ASIO and the Networking TS:\n http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-1.html http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-2.html http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-3.html http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-4.html http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-5.html  "

As usually you\u0026rsquo;d need to define a print routine for any custom error code you\u0026rsquo;d write anyway, there is actually very little extra boilerplate here. If you implement the default_error_condition() override, you can allow code exclusively written to understand boost::system::errc alone to examine your custom error code domain for equivalence to the standard error conditions, AND without being recompiled.  This documentation recommends that when you define your custom enum for representing error_codes, you should always make sure that value 0 never represents an actual error: it should either represent a success or should not be provided at all. If you only intend to use your enum inside result\u0026lt;\u0026gt; or outcome\u0026lt;\u0026gt; you can just start your enumerations from 1. If you intend to also return boost::system::error_code directly from functions, you should probably define value 0 as success, so that you are able to inform about function\u0026rsquo;s success by returning MyEnum::Success. This is because error_code\u0026rsquo;s contextual conversion to bool (which some people use to check if there was an error or not) only checks for the numeric value of the error code (without looking at error domain (category)).\n [1]: The only documentation I\u0026rsquo;m aware of is the quite old guide by Chris Kohlhoff, founder of ASIO and the Networking TS:\n http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-1.html http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-2.html http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-3.html http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-4.html http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-5.html  "

Compiler error messages are enormously clearer if you encode the permitted overloads for construction into the make\u0026lt;file_handle\u0026gt; type rather than letting a variadic free function fail to resolve an appropriate overload. Resolving variadic free function overloads is not constant time for the compiler, whereas resolving the type specialisation for make\u0026lt;file_handle\u0026gt; is constant time. In other words, free functions are expensive on build times, whereas fully specialised types are not. It actually turns out to be quite useful when writing generic code to pass around object constructing factory objects all of which have no parameters for their call operator. It becomes, effectively, a lazy construction mechanism.  "

	"content": "A program\u0026rsquo;s thread of execution can enter a \u0026ldquo;disappointing\u0026rdquo; state for two reasons:\n due to disappointing situation in the environment (operating system, external input), or due to a bug in the program.  The key to handling these disappointments correctly is to identify to which category they belong, and use the tools adequate for a given category. In this tutorial when we say \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;failure\u0026rdquo; we only refer to the first category. A bug is not an error.\nA bug is when a program is something else than what it is supposed to be. The correct action in that case is to change the program so that it is exactly what it is supposed to be. Unfortunately, sometimes the symptoms of a bug are only detected when the system is running and at this point no code changes are possible.\nIn contrast, a failure is when a correct function in a correct program reflects some disappointing behavior in the environment. The correct action in that case is for the program to take a control path different than usual, which will likely cancel some operations and will likely result in different communication with the outside world.\nSymptoms of bugs can sometimes be detected during compilation or static program analysis or at run-time when observing certain values of objects that are declared never to be valid at certain points. One classical example is passing a null pointer to functions that expect a pointer to a valid object:\nint f(int * pi) // expects: pi != nullptr { return *pi + 1; }  Passing a null pointer where it is not expected is so common a bug that tools are very good at finding them. For instance, static analyzers will usually detect it without even executing your code. Similarly, tools like undefined behavior sanitizers will compile a code as the one above so that a safety check is performed to check if the pointer is null, and an error message will be logged and program optionally terminated.\nMore, compilers can perform optimizations based on undefined behavior caused by dereferencing a null pointer. In the following code:\npair\u0026lt;int, int\u0026gt; g(int * pi) // expects: pi != nullptr { int i = *pi + 1; int j = (pi == nullptr) ? 1 : 0; return {i, j}; }  The compiler can see that if pi is null, the program would have undefined behavior. Since undefined behavior is required by the C++ standard to never be the programmer\u0026rsquo;s intention, the compiler assumes that apparently this function is never called with pi == nullptr. If so, j is always 0 and the code can be transformed to a faster one:\npair\u0026lt;int, int\u0026gt; g(int * pi) // expects: pi != nullptr { int i = *pi + 1; int j = 0; return {i, j}; }  Functions like the one above that declare that certain values of input parameters must not be passed to them are said to have a narrow contract.\nCompilers give you non-standard tools to tell them about narrow contracts, so that they can detect it and make use of it the same way as they are detecting invalid null pointers. For instance, if a function in your library takes an int and declares that the value of this int must never be negative. You can use __builtin_trap() available in GCC and clang:\nvoid h(int i) // expects: i \u0026gt;= 0 { if (i \u0026lt; 0) __builtin_trap(); // normal program logic follows ... }  This instruction when hit, causes the program to exit abnormally, which means:\n a debugger can be launched, static analyzer can warn you if it can detect a program flow that reaches this point, UB-sanitizer can log error message when it hits it.  Another tool you could use is __builtin_unreachable(), also available in GCC and clang:\nvoid h(int i) // expects: i \u0026gt;= 0 { if (i \u0026lt; 0) __builtin_unreachable(); // normal program logic follows ... }  This gives a hint to the tools: the programmer guarantees that the program flow will never reach to the point of executing it. In other words, it is undefined behavior if control reaches this point. Compiler and other tools can take this for granted. This way they can deduce that expression i \u0026lt; 0 will never be true, and they can further use this assumption to issue warnings or to optimize the code. UB-sanitizers can use it to inject a log message and terminate if this point is nonetheless reached.\nAllowing for some input values to be invalid works similarly to cyclic redundancy checks. It allows for the possibility to observe the symptoms of the bugs (not the bugs themselves), and if the symptom is revealed the hunt for the bug can start. This is not only tools that can now easily detect symptoms of bugs, but also humans during the code review. A reviewer can now say, \u0026ldquo;hey, function h() is expecting a non-negative value, but this i is actually -1; maybe you wanted to pass j instead?\u0026ldquo;.\n"

	"content": "Back in The payload, we mentioned that there was no default implicit conversion of file_io_error (status_code\u0026lt;_file_io_error_domain\u0026gt;) to error, as error is too small to hold _file_io_error_domain::value_type.\nWe can tell the framework about available implicit conversions by defining an ADL discovered free function make_status_code() which takes our custom status code as input, and returns an error:\n// Now tell `error` how it can implicitly construct from `file_io_error`. // This is done by us defining a free function called `make_status_code()` // which is discovered using ADL. `error` is an alias to the refinement // `status_code\u0026lt;erased\u0026lt;intptr_t\u0026gt;\u0026gt;` which is a status code whose value type // has been erased into an `intptr_t`. `status_code\u0026lt;erased\u0026lt;intptr_t\u0026gt;\u0026gt;` // (i.e. `error`) are move bitcopying (P1029) i.e. they are move-only // types whose move operation is defined to leave the source in the same // representation as a default constructed instance, and for whose // non-trivial destructor when called upon a default constructed instance // is guaranteed to do nothing. inline outcome_e::system_code make_status_code(file_io_error v) { // `make_status_code_ptr()` dynamically allocates memory to store an  // instance of `file_io_error`, then returns a status code whose domain  // specifies that its value type is a pointer to `file_io_error`.

	"content": " v2.2.5 ??? (Boost 1.81) [release] Enhancements:  Update to latest status-code in Experimental.Outcome, which relocates its header files and may cause some end user inclusions to need path changes.  Bug fixes: v2.2.4 11th August 2022 (Boost 1.80) [release] Enhancements:  Update to latest status-code in Experimental.Outcome, which has some breaking changes and important bug fixes.\n Add generator\u0026lt;T, Executor = void\u0026gt; to coroutine awaitables.\n Add optional Executor template parameter to all Outcome awaitable types for improved compatibility with third party software such as ASIO.\n To Experimental.Outcome add clone() for basic_result and basic_outcome types whose EC is a status_code. Erased status codes are move-only which makes the Result/Outcome type move-only, but they provide a cloning function, so this convenience function both clones the status code and propagates the spare storage so stack backtraces etc are also cloned.\n Add type constraints to success() and failure() to disable them if they aren\u0026rsquo;t available.\n Work around a bug in GCC\u0026rsquo;s C++ Coroutines implementation whereby one gets an ICE from gimplify_expr in any OUTCOME_CO_TRY taking even a mildly complex expression, which obviously is a showstopper. The work around assigns the failure type to a stack temporary before co_return-ing that temporary. Thanks to RVO pre-17 and copy elision since, this should add no runtime overhead.\n  Bug fixes:  #261 Move assignable with move constructible not available did not work with void.  v2.2.3 17th March 2022 (Boost 1.79) [release] Enhancements:  Standalone Outcome permanently locks ABI to v2.2.3 release From this release onwards, you are guaranteed that any code compiled with v2.2.3 Outcome or newer will link without issue with any code compiled with a different version of Outcome after v2.2.3. As a result, OUTCOME_UNSTABLE_VERSION is no longer defined by default, and therefore OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE is now hard coded to outcome_v2 rather than a namespace which permutes per commit.  Bug fixes:  #255 Fix enabling of move assignable was not calculated correctly.  v2.2.2 8th December 2021 (Boost 1.78) [release] Enhancements:  #255 Restore Experimental Outcome constexpr compatibility in C++ 20 which was an undocumented property of the Outcome v2.1 series, and which had been dropped in the v2.2 series. GCC Coroutines support Coroutine support in GCCs after 10 is now correctly detected.  Bug fixes:  None.  v2.2.1 13th August 2021 (Boost 1.77) [release] Bug fixes:  #251 Fix failure to compile Boost.Outcome when the compiler declares support for C++ modules.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t use [[likely]] in GCCs before 9.\n #251 Make support for C++ modules opt-in.\n  v2.2.0 16th April 2021 (Boost 1.76) [release]  BREAKING CHANGE As announced for a year and three Boost releases, Outcome v2.2 became the default, replacing v2.1. All v2.1 Outcome code will need to be upgraded as described in the v2.1 =\u0026gt; v2.2 upgrade guide. This branch has a number of major breaking changes to Outcome v2.1, see the list of v2.2 major changes.  Enhancements:  VS2019.8 compatibility VS2019.8 changed how to enable Coroutines, which caused Outcome to not compile on that compiler. #237 If on C++ 20, we now use C++ 20 [[likely]] instead of compiler-specific markup to indicate when TRY has likely success or failure. BREAKING CHANGE #247 Previously the value of spare_storage(const basic_result|basic_outcome *) noexcept was not propagated over OUTCOME_TRY, which causes things like stack backtraces captured at the point of construction of an errored result to get dropped at every TRY point. This has been fixed by adding an optional spare_storage to success_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; and failure_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; , as well as to auto success(T \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, ...) and auto failure(T \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, ...) .\nYou should not notice this in your code, except that where before spare storage values did not propagate through TRY, now they do, which is a breaking change.\n  Bug fixes:  BREAKING CHANGE #244 It came as a shock to learn that OUTCOME_TRY had been broken since the inception of this library for certain corner case code:\noutcome::result\u0026lt;Foo\u0026gt; get_foo(); outcome::result\u0026lt;Foo\u0026gt; filter1(outcome::result\u0026lt;Foo\u0026gt; \u0026amp;\u0026amp;); outcome::result\u0026lt;Foo\u0026gt; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; filter2(outcome::result\u0026lt;Foo\u0026gt; \u0026amp;\u0026amp;); // This works fine, and always has OUTCOME_TRY(auto v, filter1(get_foo())) // This causes UB due to result\u0026lt;Foo\u0026gt; being destructed before move of value into v OUTCOME_TRY(auto v, filter2(get_foo()))  Whilst reference passthrough filter functions are not common, they can turn up in highly generic code, where destruction before copy/move is not helpful.\nThe cause is that TRY used to work by binding the result of the expression to an auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;unique, testing if that unique if successful or not, and if successful then moving from unique.value() into the user\u0026rsquo;s output variable. If the expression returned is a prvalue, the Result\u0026rsquo;s lifetime is extended by the bound reference to outside of the statement, and all is good. If the expression returned is an xvalue or lvalue, then the lifetime extension does not exceed that of the statement, and the Result is destructed after the semicolon succeeding the assignment to auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;unique.\nThis bug has been fixed by TRY deducing the value category of its input expression as follows:\n prvalues =\u0026gt; auto unique = (expr) (breaking change) xvalue =\u0026gt; auto unique = (expr) (breaking change) lvalue =\u0026gt; auto unique = (expr) (breaking change)  This ensures that xvalue and lvalue inputs do not cause unhelpfully early lifetime end, though it does silently change the behaviour of existing code which relied on rvalues and lvalues being passed through, as a new construct-move-destruct or construct-copy-destruct cycle is introduced to where there was none before. Also, before C++ 17, there is now an added copy/move for prvalue inputs, which does not affect runtime codegen due to Return Value Optimisation (RVO), but does cause Results containing non-copying non-moving types to fail to compile, which is a breaking change from beforehand.\nIf one wishes rvalues or lvalues to be passed through, one can avail of a new TRY syntax based on preprocessor overloading:\n OUTCOME_TRY((refspec, varname), expr) OUTCOME_TRYV2(refspec, expr)  Here refspec is the storage to be used for both the internal temporary unique, AND varname. So if you write:\nFoo \u0026amp;\u0026amp;foo; OUTCOME_TRY((auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, v), filter2(foo))  \u0026hellip; then the internal unique is declared as auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;unique = (filter2(foo)), and the output variable is declared as auto \u0026amp;\u0026amp;v = std::move(unique).assume_value(). This passes through the rvalue referencing, and completely avoids copies and moves of Foo. If you wish to not extract the value but also specify unique storage, there is a new OUTCOME_TRYV2(refspec, expr).\nMy thanks to KamilCuk from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66069152/token-detection-within-a-c-preprocessor-macro-argument for all their help in designing the new overloaded TRY syntax. My thanks also to vasama for reporting this issue and working through how best to fix it with me.\n #249 The preprocessor logic for choosing when to use bool with concept on GCC was yet again refactored. This should fix those choices of GCC configuration which caused failure due to the wrong combination being chosen.\n  v2.1.5 11th December 2020 (Boost 1.75) [release] Enhancements:  The ADL discovered event hooks have been replaced with policy-specified event hooks instead This is due to brittleness (where hooks would quietly self-disable if somebody changed something), compiler bugs (a difference in compiler settings causes the wrong hooks, or some but not all hooks, to get discovered), and end user difficulty in using them at all. The policy-specified event hooks can be told to default to ADL discovered hooks for backwards compatibility: set OUTCOME_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPPORT_FOR to less than 220 to enable emulation. Improve configuring OUTCOME_GCC6_CONCEPT_BOOL Older GCCs had boolean based concepts syntax, whereas newer GCCs are standards conforming. However the precise logic of when to use legacy and conforming syntax was not well understood, which caused Outcome to fail to compile depending on what options you pass to GCC. The new logic always uses the legacy syntax if on GCC 8 or older, otherwise we use conforming syntax if and only if GCC is in C++ 20 mode or later. This hopefully will resolve the corner case build failures on GCC.  Bug fixes:  Boost.Outcome should now compile with BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS defined Thanks to Emil, maintainer of Boost.Exception, making a change for me, Boost.Outcome should now compile with C++ exceptions globally disabled. You won\u0026rsquo;t be able to use boost::exception_ptr as it can\u0026rsquo;t be included if C++ exceptions are globally disabled. #236 In the Coroutine support the final_suspend() was not noexcept, despite being required to be so in the C++ 20 standard. This has been fixed, but only if your compiler implements noop_coroutine. Additionally, if noop_coroutine is available, we use the much more efficient coroutine handle returning variant of await_suspend() which should significantly improve codegen and context switching performance.  v2.1.4 14th August 2020 (Boost 1.74) [release] Enhancements:  BREAKING CHANGE void results and outcomes no longer default construct types during explicit construction Previously if you explicitly constructed a result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; from a non-errored result\u0026lt;void\u0026gt;, it default constructed T. This was found to cause unhelpful surprise, so it has been disabled. New macro OUTCOME_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPPORT_FOR The macro OUTCOME_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPPORT_FOR can be used to enable aliasing of older naming and features to newer naming and features when using a newer version of Outcome. Concepts now have snake case style naming instead of camel case style When Outcome was first implemented, it was thought that C++ 20 concepts were going to have camel case style. This was changed before the C++ 20 release, and Outcome\u0026rsquo;s concepts have been renamed similarly. This won\u0026rsquo;t break any code in Outcome v2.1, as compatibility aliases are provided. However code compiled against Outcome v2.2 will need to be upgraded, unless OUTCOME_ENABLE_LEGACY_SUPPORT_FOR is set to less than 220. Concepts now live in OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::concepts namespace Previously concepts lived in the convert namespace, now they live in their own namespace. New concepts basic_result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; and basic_outcome\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; added End users were finding an unhelpful gap in between is_basic_result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; and value_or_error\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; where they wanted a concept that matched types which were basic_result, but not exactly one of those. Concepts filling that gap were added. Operation TRY works differently from Outcome v2.2 onwards This is a severely code breaking change which change the syntax of how one uses OUTCOME_TRY(). A regular expression suitable for upgrading code can be found in the list of changes between Outcome v2.1 and v2.2.  Bug fixes:  #224 The clang Apple ships in Xcode 11.4 (currently the latest) has not been patched with the fixes to LLVM clang that fix noexcept(std::is_constructible\u0026lt;T, void\u0026gt;) failing to compile which I originally submitted years ago. So give up waiting on Apple to fix their clang, add a workaround to Outcome. Use of void in T or E caused noexcept(false) Direct traits examination of void was causing nothrow detection to return false, fixed. Spare storage could not be used from within no-value policy classes Due to an obvious brain fart when writing the code at the time, the spare storage APIs had the wrong prototype which prevented them working from within policy classes. Sorry.  v2.1.3 29th April 2020 (Boost 1.73) [release] Enhancements:  Performance of Outcome-based code compiled by clang has been greatly improved The previous implementation of Outcome\u0026rsquo;s status bitfield confused clang\u0026rsquo;s optimiser, which caused low quality codegen. Unlike most codegen issues, this was noticeably in empirical benchmarks of real world code, as was shown by P1886 Error speed benchmarking.\nThe safe part of the better_optimisation Outcome v2.2.0 future branch was merged to Outcome v2.1.3 which includes a new status bitfield implementation. This appears to not confuse clang\u0026rsquo;s optimiser, and clang 9 produces code which routinely beats GCC 9\u0026rsquo;s code for various canned use cases.\n Precompiled headers are automatically enabled on new enough cmake\u0026rsquo;s for standalone Outcome If on cmake 3.16 or later, its new precompiled headers build support is used to tell consumers of the outcome::hl cmake target to precompile Outcome, if and only if PROJECT_IS_DEPENDENCY is false. PROJECT_IS_DEPENDENCY is set by Outcome\u0026rsquo;s CMakeLists.txt if it detects that it was included using add_subdirectory(), so for the vast majority of Outcome end users, the use of precompiled headers will NOT be enabled.\nExported targets do NOT request precompilation of headers, as it is assumed that importers of the Outcome cmake targets will configure their own precompiled headers which incorporate Outcome.\n Installability is now CI tested per commit Due to installability of standalone Outcome (e.g. make install) breaking itself rather more frequently than is ideal, installability is now tested on CI per commit.\n Coroutines support has been documented The coroutines support added in v2.1.2 has now been properly documented.\n  Bug fixes:  #214 Newer Concepts implementing compilers were unhappy with the early check for destructibility of T and E, so removed template constraints, falling back to static assert which runs later in the type instantiation sequence. #215 For standalone Outcome, CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is now passed through during dependency superbuild. This should solve build issues for some embedded toolchain users. #220 A false positive undefined behaviour sanitiser failure in some use cases of Experimental Outcome was worked around to avoid the failure message. #221 Restored compatibility with x86 on Windows, which was failing with link errors. It was quite surprising that this bug was not reported sooner, but obviously almost nobody is using Outcome with x86 on Windows. #223 Fix a segfault in Debug builds only when cloning a status_code_ptr in Experimental.Outcome only.  v2.1.2 11th December 2019 (Boost 1.72) [release] Enhancements:  Improved compatibility with cmake tooling Standalone outcome is now make install-able, and cmake find_package() can find it. Note that you must separately install and find_package() Outcome\u0026rsquo;s dependency, quickcpplib, else find_package() of Outcome will fail. Non-permissive parsing is now default in Visual Studio The default targets in standalone Outcome\u0026rsquo;s cmake now enable non-permissive parsing. This was required partially because VS2019 16.3\u0026rsquo;s quite buggy Concepts implementation is unusuable in permissive parsing mode. Even then, lazy ADL two phase lookup is broken in VS2019 16.3 with /std:latest, you may wish to use an earlier language standard. Breaking change! The git submodule mechanism used by standalone Outcome of specifying dependent libraries has been replaced with a cmake superbuild of dependencies mechanism instead. Upon cmake configure, an internal copy of quickcpplib will be git cloned, built and installed into the build directory from where an internal find_package() uses it. This breaks the use of the unconfigured Outcome repo as an implementation of Outcome, one must now do one of:  Add Outcome as subdirectory to cmake build. Use cmake superbuild (i.e. ExternalProject_Add()) to build and install Outcome into a local installation. Use one of the single header editions.  Breaking change! For standalone Outcome, the current compiler is now checked for whether it will compile code containing C++ Concepts, and if it does, all cmake consumers of Outcome will enable C++ Concepts. Set the cmake variable CXX_CONCEPTS_FLAGS to an empty string to prevent auto detection and enabling of C++ Concepts support occurring. OUTCOME_TRY operation now hints to the compiler that operation will be successful P1886 Error speed benchmarking showed that there is considerable gain in very small functions by hinting to the compiler whether the expression is expected to be successful or not. OUTCOME_TRY previously did not hint to the compiler at all, but now it does. A new suite of macros OUTCOME_TRY_FAILURE_LIKELY hint to the compiler that failure is expected. If you wish to return to the previously unhinted behaviour, define OUTCOME_TRY_LIKELY(expr) to (!!expr). #199 Support for C++ Coroutines has been added. This comes in two parts, firstly there is now an OUTCOME_CO_TRY() operation suitable for performing the TRY operation from within a C++ Coroutine. Secondly, in the header outcome/coroutine_support.hpp there are implementations of eager\u0026lt;OutcomeType\u0026gt; and lazy\u0026lt;OutcomeType\u0026gt; which let you more naturally and efficiently use basic_result or basic_outcome from within C++ Coroutines \u0026ndash; specifically, if the result or outcome will construct from an exception pointer, exceptions thrown in the coroutine return an errored or excepted result with the thrown exception instead of throwing the exception through the coroutine machinery (which in current compilers, has a high likelihood of blowing up the program). Both eager\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; and lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; can accept any T as well. Both have been tested and found working on VS2019 and clang 9. #210 make_error_code() and make_exception_ptr() are now additionally considered for compatible copy and move conversions for basic_result\u0026lt;\u0026gt;. This lets you construct a basic_result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; into a basic_result\u0026lt;T, error_code\u0026gt;, where E is a custom type which has implemented the ADL discovered free function error_code make_error_code(E), but is otherwise unrelated to error_code. The same availability applies for exception_ptr with make_exception_ptr() being the ADL discovered free function. basic_outcome\u0026lt;\u0026gt; has less support for this than basic_result\u0026lt;\u0026gt; in order to keep constructor count down, but it will accept via this mechanism conversions from basic_result\u0026lt;\u0026gt; and failure_type\u0026lt;\u0026gt;.  Bug fixes:  #184 The detection of [[nodiscard]] support in the compiler was very mildly broken.  v2.1.1 19th August 2019 (Boost 1.71) [release] Enhancements:  #184 As per request from Boost release managers, relocated version.hpp and revision.hpp into detail, and added the Boost licence boilerplate to the top of every source file which was missing one (I think). Also took the opportunity to run the licence restamping script over all Outcome, so copyright dates are now up to date. #185 Add FAQ item explaining issue #185, and why we will do nothing to fix it right now. #189 Refactored the OUTCOME_TRY implementation to use more clarified customisation points capable of accepting very foreign inputs. Removed the std::experimental::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; specialisations, as those are no longer necessary. Fixed the documentation for the customisation points which previously claimed that they are ADL discovered, which they are not. Added a recipe describing how to add in support for foreign input types. #183 Added a separate motivation/plug_error_code specifically for Boost.  Bug fixes:  - OUTCOME_VERSION_MINOR hadn\u0026rsquo;t been updated to 1. #181 Fix issue #181 where Outcome didn\u0026rsquo;t actually implement the strong swap guarantee, despite being documented as doing so. #190 Fix issue #190 in Boost edition where unit test suite was not runnable from the Boost release distro. #182 Fix issue #182 where trait::is_exception_ptr_available\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; was always true, thus causing much weirdness, like not printing diagnostics and trying to feed everything to make_exception_ptr(). #194 Fix issue #192 where the std::basic_outcome_failure_exception_from_error() was being defined twice for translation units which combine standalone and Boost Outcome\u0026rsquo;s.  v2.1 12th Apr 2019 (Boost 1.70) [release]  #180\n success() and failure() now produce types marked [[nodiscard]].  include/outcome/outcome.natvis is now namespace permuted like the rest of Outcome, so debugging Outcome based code in Visual Studio should look much prettier than before.\n #162\n .has_failure() was returning false at times when it should have returned true.  #152\n GCC 5 no longer can compile Outcome at all due to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45607450/gcc5-nested-variable-template-is-not-a-function-template. Added explicit version trap for GCC 5 to say it can not work. Note this is not a breaking change, GCC 5 was never supported officially in any v2 Outcome.  #150\n BREAKING CHANGE result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;, boost_result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; and std_result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; no longer implement hard UB on fetching a value from a valueless instance if E is a UDT, they now fail to compile with a useful error message. If you wish hard UB, use unchecked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;, boost_unchecked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; or std_unchecked\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; instead.  #140\n Fixed a nasty corner case bug where value type\u0026rsquo;s without a copy constructor but with a move constructor would indicate via traits that copy construction was available. Thanks to Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s compiler team for reporting this issue.  Added experimental status_result and status_outcome based on experimental status_code.\n Boost edition is now 100% Boost, so defaults for result and outcome are boost::system::error_code::errc_t and boost::exception_ptr. Moreover, the test suite in the Boost edition now exclusively tests the Boost edition. One can, of course, freely use the standalone edition with Boost, and the Boost edition with std types.\n Renamed ADL discovered customisation point throw_as_system_error_with_payload() to outcome_throw_as_system_error_with_payload().\n #135\n Added much clearer compile failure when user tries result\u0026lt;T, T\u0026gt; or outcome where two or more types are identical. Thanks to Andrzej Krzemieński for suggesting a technique which combines SFINAE correctness with the remaining ability for result\u0026lt;T, T\u0026gt; etc to be a valid type, but not constructible.  #67\n Fixed one of the oldest long open bugs in Outcome, that the noexcept unit tests failed on OS X for an unknown reason.  #115\n Outcome did not construct correctly from failure_type.  Inexplicably outcome\u0026rsquo;s error + exception constructor had been removed. Nobody noticed during the Boost peer review, which is worrying seeing as that constructor is needed for one of the main advertised features to Boost!\n #107 and #116\n operator== and operator!= now become disabled if the value, error and exception types do not implement the same operator. Relatedly, both comparison operators simply didn\u0026rsquo;t work right. Fixed.  #109\n swap() now has correct noexcept calculation and now correctly orders the swaps to be whichever is the throwing swap first.  Added reference dump of v2.1 ABI so we can check if ABI breakage detection works in the next set of changes, plus Travis job to check ABI and API compatibility per commit.\n #124\n OUTCOME_TRY is now overloaded and selects void or auto edition according to input parameter count.  #120\n Fix generation of double underscored temporary variables in OUTCOME_UNIQUE_NAME, which is UB.  #110\n Separated result from its hard coded dependency on the \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; header. Renamed result and outcome to basic_result and basic_outcome. Renamed result.hpp into basic_result.hpp. Moved \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;exception\u0026gt; dependent code into new std_result.hpp and std_outcome.hpp header files. Added boost_result.hpp and boost_outcome.hpp which use Boost.System and Boost.Exception (these are result.hpp and outcome.hpp in the Boost edition).   v2.0 18th Jan 2018 [release]  Boost peer review edition. This is what was reviewed. Changelog from v1 can be found in the release notes for this release.  "

	"content": " You now know everything you need to get started with using Outcome immediately.\nThe initial temptation for most beginners will be to use a bespoke strongly typed enumeration on a case by case basis i.e. a \u0026ldquo;once off\u0026rdquo; custom E type. This is usually due to experience in other languages with sum types e.g. Rust, Haskell, Swift etc.\nHowever this is C++! Not Rust, not Swift, not Haskell! I must caution you to always avoid using custom E types in public APIs. The reason is that every time library A using custom E1 type must interface with library B using custom E2 type, you must map between those E1 and E2 types.\nThis is information lossy, i.e. fidelity of failure gets lost after multiple translations. It involves writing, and then maintaining, a lot of annoying boilerplate. It leaks internal implementation detail, and fails to separate concerns. And one cannot use OUTCOME_TRYV(expr)/OUTCOME_TRY(expr) if there is no convertibility between E types.\nThe C++ 11 standard library, and Boost, specifically ships \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; for the purpose of wrapping up individual custom E types into a generic framework, where disparate custom E types can discover and interact with one another. That ships with every C++ compiler.\nFor all these reasons, this is why result and outcome default the EC type to error code. You should leave that default alone where possible.\ntl;dr; Please plug your library into std::error_code, or equivalent, and do not expose custom E types in ANY public API. result and outcome default EC to an error code for good reason.\n"

Solving this well is the coup de grâce of Outcome against alternative approaches to this problem domain, including std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;. It is the major reason why you should consider using Outcome over alternatives, including Expected.\nFirstly we shall explore some of the problems faced by the software developer when T|E return type based code proliferates at scale, where dozens of libraries may be using completely incompatible T|E return types.\nSecondly we shall introduce the ValueOrError concept support in Outcome, which implements a subset of the proposed WG21 ValueOrError concept framework.\nFinally, we shall then step through a worked example which mocks up a realistic situation that the software developer may find themselves in: tying together disparate third party libraries, whose source code cannot be modified, into an application-wide, mixed-mode T|E and exception throwing universal error handling system which is capable of accurately representing the original failure, but also propagating it in a way that the application can deal with universally.\n"

In October 2014 I added in the original prototype Boost.Expected reference library as a git submodule, and began developing a non-allocating future\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;/promise\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; as an extension of expected\u0026lt;T, std::exception_ptr\u0026gt; as a faster, monadic future-promise was something which AFIO v1 sorely needed.\nThe original prototype Boost.Expected library was a large and very complex beastie. I was fortunate to be employed on a contract in late 2014 early 2015 where I saw it deployed at scale into an existing large C++ codebase. Expected was really great and powerful, but it absolutely murdered compile times in a large C++ codebase, and made LTO effectively infeasible. I also found its implementation non-conducive to implementing future-promise with it, and so I resolved to implement a much more powerful policy driven monad factory which could stamp out everything from an option\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; right through to a future-promise pair, all using the exact same basic_monad\u0026lt;\u0026gt; and therefore all with a full monadic programming API, C++ 17 continuations/monadic bind and intelligently convertible into one another. Moreover, all this needed to have an absolute minimum impact on compile times and runtime overheads, neither of which were strengths of the original prototype Boost.Expected library.\nBy August 2015 \u0026ldquo;Boost.Monad\u0026rdquo; was delivering on all those requirements and then some, but it lacked maturity through use in other code. Summer 2015 saw the Boost peer review of AFIO v1 which was roundly rejected. After considering the ample review feedback, it was realised that AFIO v2 would be a very different design, one no longer using futures, memory allocation nor C++ exceptions. As AFIO v2 was started from scratch and using Outcome heavily from the very beginning (every AFIO v2 API returns a result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;), Outcome began to gain bug fixes and shed features, with the non-allocating future-promise implementation being dropped in May 2016 and a large chunk of type based metaprogramming being replaced with cleaner variable template metaprogramming in June. After CppCon 2016 in September, then began the long process of getting Outcome ready for Boost peer review in Q1 2017 which involved a repeated sequence of complete rewrites of the tutorial in response to multiple rounds of feedback from the C++ community, with at least four complete rewrites currently at the time of writing.\nIn parallel to all this development on Outcome, Expected went before the LEWG and entered the C++ standards track. As the WG21 meetings went by, Expected experienced a period of being stripped back and much of the complexity which had so murdered compile and link times in 2014-2015 fell away, thus the Expected proposed in P0323R1 ended up landing so close to Outcome that in January 2017 it was just a few hours work to implement Expected using the core basic_monad infrastructure in Outcome. That highly flexible policy based design which made monadic future-promise possible made it similarly easy to implement a highly conforming Expected, indeed in early 2017 Outcome\u0026rsquo;s Expected was much closer to P0323R1 than any other implementation including the LEWG reference implementation. And unlike the LEWG reference implementation, Outcome has had eighteen months of that finely tuned patina you only get when a library is in use by other code bases.\nIn February 2017 it became realised that the userbase really wanted a high quality expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; implementation rather than anything similar but not the same which Outcome had invented. The only just implemented Expected implementation based on basic_monad therefore took primacy. The final rewrite of the documentation before peer review submission was one which made it look like Outcome was primarily an expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; implementation with a few useful extensions like outcome\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; and result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;. I was sad to so pivot, but it was obvious that Outcome would see far wider popularity and usage as primarily an Expected implementation.\nAlmost three years after its beginning, Outcome v1 finally went before Boost peer review in May 2017 which turned into one of the longest and most detailed peer reviews Boost has done in recent years, with over 800 pieces of review feedback submitted. It was by consensus rejected, with substantial feedback on what to do instead.\nOutcome v2 (2018) During the very lengthy peer review, roughly three groups of opinion emerged as to what a value|error transporting class ought to look like:\n 1. Lightweight A simple-as-possible T and/or E transport without any implementation complexity. 2. Medium A variant stored T or E1 ... En where T is the expected value and E1 ... are the potential unexpected values. This implemention really ought to be implemented using C++ 17's std::variant except with stronger never-empty guarantees.  3. Heavy A full fat Either monad participating fully in a wider monadic programming framework for C++.  Peter Dimov was very quickly able to implement an expected\u0026lt;T, E1, ...\u0026gt; using his variant2 library, and thus there seemed little point in replicating his work in an Outcome v2. The lightweight choice seemed to be the best path forwards, so in June 2017 the bare minimum result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; and outcome\u0026lt;T, EC, P\u0026gt; as presented in this library was built, using the same constructor design as std::variant\u0026lt;...\u0026gt;. Significant backwards compatibility with v1 Outcome code was retained, as the review had felt the basic proposed design fine.\nA period of maturation then followed by porting a large existing codebase using Outcome v1 to v2, and writing a significant amount of new code using v2 to test it for unanticipated surprises and bugs. Quite a few corner cases were found and fixed. At the end of September 2017, Outcome v2 was deemed to be \u0026ldquo;mature\u0026rdquo;, and a script generated \u0026ldquo;Boost edition\u0026rdquo; made available.\nAll that remained before it was ready for a second Boost peer review was the documentation. This took four months to write (same time as to write the library itself!), and in January 2018 Outcome had its second Boost peer review, which it passed!\nOutcome v2.1 (2019 - 2020) The changes requsted during the review of v2.0 were fairly modest: result and outcome would be renamed to basic_result and basic_outcome, and a clean separation of concerns between the basic_* layer and the \u0026ldquo;convenience\u0026rdquo; layer would be created. That suited Outcome nicely, as the basic_* layer could have minimum possible header dependencies and thus minimum possible build times impact, which was great for big iron users with multi-million line C++ codebases. This also had the nice side effect of permitting both Boost and std implementations to be supported concurrently in both Outcome and Boost.Outcome.\nBy April 2018, v2.1 was feature complete and entered a six month period of maturation and battle hardening under its already extensive userbase. However Outcome passing its review in January 2018 had much more consequence than I could have ever expected. Unbeknownst to me, some of the WG21 leadership had interpreted the success of Outcome, and especially its divergences from WG21 Expected into a more complete substitute for C++ exception handling, as a sign that the C++ exception handling mechanism was no longer fit for purpose. It was thus proposed to remedy the standard exception handling mechanism into something much more efficient, thus rendering Outcome obsolete in future C++ standards (P0709 Zero overhead exceptions).\nConcurrently to that, just before the review of Outcome 2.0, I had mooted a number of semantic and compile time performance improvements to \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; with the proposal that we mildly break Boost.System with improvements and see how badly real world code broke in response. This was not widely accepted at that time (though they have been since incorporated into Boost.System, and proposed defect remedies for \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt; for C++ 23). I therefore wrote an improved \u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt; which fixed all the problems listed at P0824 (Summary of SG14 discussion on \u0026lt;system_error\u0026gt;) and fixed up Outcome so one could use it without any system error implementation, or with the STL one or with the proposed improved one. This improved \u0026lt;system_error2\u0026gt; was then proposed as the standard library support for Zero overhead exceptions as proposed std::error.\nA flurry of papers and discussion then resulted, running up to the Prague 2020 WG21 meeting where WG21 liked the library part of deterministic exceptions i.e. std::error, and wanted to see a working implementation of a compiler implementing the language part before moving further. The covid pandemic then ceased face to face meetings which deeply impacted WG21 productivity, so everything large which was not yet approved for entry into C++ 23 went on pause.\nOutcome v2.2 (2021) Outcome was sufficiently popular, and widely known as the closest simulacrum of deterministic exceptions currently available in C++, that it was regularly benchmarked as such on an \u0026lsquo;as if\u0026rsquo; basis by a number of people in the wider C++ ecosystem, including comparing their \u0026lsquo;better Outcome alternatives\u0026rsquo; to Outcome, where invariably Outcome appeared to lose badly in various synthetic tests. Whilst any empirical measurements in the real world code never showed a statistically significant difference, it was certainly true that v2.1\u0026rsquo;s codegen in assembler was not ideal.\nOn the behalf of WG21, Ben Craig did some benchmarking work on Outcome v2.1 in P1886 Error speed benchmarking, where it did not perform as well as expected compared to alternatives such as returning a simple integer from a function. This led to a better_optimisation branch. The changes were felt worth merging into Outcome as v2.2.0, the first major version release since Outcome entered Boost in early 2019. To give enough time to sign post to users that these source incompatible changes were coming, all of 2020 was given over to announcement of the upcoming merge of the breaking v2.2 branch into master branch in early 2021.\nIn terms of codegen benefits for proposed std::error based code (i.e. code using Outcome experimental), v2.2 implements a library-based emulation of P1029 move = bitcopies, a proposed compiler enhancement which can treat some move-only types as bags of bits. This very significantly improves the appearance in assembler of experimental Outcome based code.\nOutcome v2.2.3 (2022) Outcome v2.2 saw much popularity and very few issues reported after a year in the wild, so the decision was taken to write the v2.2.3 Outcome ABI into stone going forward. This is the guarantee that binaries compiled with the v2.2.3 release will link and work without issue with binaries compiled with any later version of Outcome.\nThis pretty much draws a line under further significant development of Outcome \u0026ndash; it has now effectively entered \u0026lsquo;sustaining\u0026rsquo;, as big multinationals would term it i.e. only small bug fixes and maintenance for future toolchains and languages etc would be expected going forth from now.\n"

And this is fine for larger projects, but for smaller projects the cost of setting up and configuring SWIG is also non-trivial.\nWhat would be really great is if result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; returning noexcept C++ functions could be used straight from C. And indeed Experimental Outcome provides just that facility which this section covers next.\n"

	"content": "This is a special function which does compiler-specific stuff to tell the compiler that this function can never, ever, ever be executed. The compiler\u0026rsquo;s optimiser will hard assume that this function can never be executed, and will prune the possibility of it being executed completely. Generally this means that the code path stops dead, and if execution does proceed down this path, it will run off the end of a branch which doesn\u0026rsquo;t go anywhere. Your program will have lost known state, and usually it will trash memory and registers and crash.\nThis may seem highly undesirable. However, it also means that the optimiser can optimise more strongly, and so long as you never actually do execute this branch, you do get higher quality code generation.\nIf the NDEBUG macro is not defined, an assert(false) is present. This will cause attempts to execute this function to fail in a very obvious way, but it also generates runtime code to trigger the obvious failure.\nIf the NDEBUG macro is defined, and the program is compiled with the undefined behaviour sanitiser, attempts to execute this function will trigger an undefined behaviour sanitiser action.\nRequires: Always available.\nComplexity: Zero runtime overhead if NDEBUG is defined, guaranteed. If this function returns, your program is now in hard loss of known program state. Usually, but not always, it will crash at some point later. Rarely it will corrupt registers and memory, and keep going.\nGuarantees: An exception is never thrown.\n"

NO SUPPORT WILL BE GIVEN HERE FOR THE ASIO CODE BELOW. Please raise any questions or problems that you have with how to implement this sort of stuff in ASIO on Stackoverflow #boost-asio.\n The real world, production-level recipe can be found at the bottom of this page. You ought to use that in any real world use case.\nIt is however worth providing a walkthrough of a simplified edition of the real world recipe, as a lot of barely documented ASIO voodoo is involved. You should not use the code presented next in your own code, it is too simplified. But it should help you understand how the real implementation works.\nFirstly we need to define some helper type sugar and a factory function for wrapping any arbitrary third party completion token with that type sugar:\nnamespace detail { // Type sugar for wrapping an external completion token  template \u0026lt;classCompletionToken\u0026gt; struct as_result_t { CompletionToken token; }; } // namespace detail  // Factory function for wrapping a third party completion token with // our type sugar template \u0026lt;classCompletionToken\u0026gt; // inline auto as_result(CompletionToken \u0026amp;\u0026amp;token) { return detail::as_result_t\u0026lt;std::decay_t\u0026lt;CompletionToken\u0026gt;\u0026gt;{std::forward\u0026lt;CompletionToken\u0026gt;(token)}; }; View this code on Github Next we tell ASIO about a new completion token it ought to recognise by specialising async_result:\n// Tell ASIO about a new kind of completion token, the kind returned // from our as_result() factory function. This implementation is // for functions with handlers void(error_code, T) only. template \u0026lt;classCompletionToken, classT\u0026gt; // struct asio::async_result\u0026lt;detail::as_result_t\u0026lt;CompletionToken\u0026gt;, //  void(error_code, T)\u0026gt; //  // NOTE we subclass for an async result taking an outcome::result  // as its completion handler. We will mangle the void(error_code, T)  // completion handler into this completion handler below.  : public asio::async_result\u0026lt;CompletionToken, void(outcome::result\u0026lt;T, error_code\u0026gt;)\u0026gt; { // The result type we shall return  using result_type = outcome::result\u0026lt;T, error_code\u0026gt;; using _base = asio::async_result\u0026lt;CompletionToken, void(result_type)\u0026gt;; // The awaitable type to be returned by the initiating function,  // the co_await of which will yield a result_type  using return_type = typename _base::return_type; // Get what would be the completion handler for the async_result  // whose completion handler is void(result_type)  using result_type_completion_handler_type = //  typename _base::completion_handler_type; View this code on Github The tricky part to understand is that our async_result specialisation inherits from an async_result for the supplied completion token type with a completion handler which consumes a result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;. Our async_result is actually therefore the base async_result, but we layer on top a completion_handler_type with the void(error_code, size_t) signature which constructs from that a result:\n// Wrap that completion handler with void(error_code, T) converting  // handler  struct completion_handler_type { // Pass through unwrapped completion token  template \u0026lt;classU\u0026gt; completion_handler_type(::detail::as_result_t\u0026lt;U\u0026gt; \u0026amp;\u0026amp;ch) : _handler(std::forward\u0026lt;U\u0026gt;(ch.token)) { } // Our completion handler spec  void operator()(error_code ec, T v) { // Call the underlying completion handler, whose  // completion function is void(result_type)  if(ec) { // Complete with a failed result  _handler(result_type(outcome::failure(ec))); return; } // Complete with a successful result  _handler(result_type(outcome::success(v))); } result_type_completion_handler_type _handler; }; // Initialise base with the underlying completion handler  async_result(completion_handler_type \u0026amp;h) : _base(h._handler) { } using _base::get; }; View this code on Github To use, simply wrap the third party completion token with as_result to cause ASIO to return from co_await a result instead of throwing exceptions on failure:\nchar buffer[1024]; asio::experimental::await_token token = co_await asio::experimental::this_coro::token(); outcome::result\u0026lt;size_t, error_code\u0026gt; bytesread = co_await skt.async_read_some(asio::buffer(buffer), as_result(token));  The real world production-level implementation below is a lot more complex than the above which has been deliberately simplified to aid exposition. The above should help you get up and running with the below, eventually.\nOne again I would like to remind you that Outcome is not the appropriate place to seek help with ASIO voodoo. Please ask on Stackoverflow #boost-asio.\nHere follows the real world, production-level adapation of Outcome into ASIO, written and maintained by Christos Stratopoulos.

First of all, we want our async_result specialization to work, in particular, with the async_result for ASIO\u0026rsquo;s use_awaitable_t completion token. With this token, the async_result specialization takes the form with a static initiate method which defers initiation of the asynchronous operation until, for example, co_await is called on the returned awaitable. Thus, our async_result specialization will take the same form. With this in mind, we need only understand how our specialization will implement its initiate method. The trick is that it will pass the initiation work off to an async_result for the supplied completion token type with a completion handler which consumes result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;. Our async_result is thus just a simple wrapper over this underlying async_result, but we inject a completion handler with the void(error_code, size_t) signature which constructs from that a result:\n// Wrap a completion handler with void(error_code, T) converting  // handler  template \u0026lt;classHandler\u0026gt; struct completion_handler { // Our completion handler spec  void operator()(error_code ec, T v) { // Call the underlying completion handler, whose  // completion function is void(result_type)  if(ec) { // Complete with a failed result  _handler(result_type(outcome::failure(ec))); return; } // Complete with a successful result  _handler(result_type(outcome::success(v))); } Handler _handler; }; // NOTE the initiate member function initiates the async operation,  // and we want to defer to what would be the initiation of the  // async_result whose handler signature is void(result_type).  template \u0026lt;classInitiation, class...

Standardese - the API reference generator (up until Outcome v2.0)  Special thanks for Outcome v2.1 Once again Andrzej Krzemienski stands out for a never ceasing flow of excellent questions, \u0026ldquo;what if?\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;s, eagle eyed spotting of corner case logic bugs, and design contradictions. Thank you Andrzej!\nMy thanks to the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler team for incorporating Outcome into the MSVC test suite, and thus finding many interesting corner case quirks in how best to interpret the C++ standard. In some cases, Outcome was refactored to be less ambiguous; in others, defects had to be submitted to WG21 because the standard wording was not clear. The Visual C++ compiler team were particularly generous with their time in helping track down the cause of these issues, complete with submitting pull requests with bug fixes. I am very grateful to them.\nSpecial thanks for Outcome v2.0 For a second time, Charley Bay stepped up as review manager. Given how much work it was for the v1 review, I can only say thank you.\nAndrzej Krzemienski went far beyond the call of duty in the development of Outcome v2. He wrote the front page, and the start of the tutorial. He thus set the tone, pacing, style and form of the tutorial which I merely continued for the rest of the tutorial. He also volunteered considerable amounts of his time as as primary peer reviewer for the v2 design and implementation, asking many very valuable \u0026ldquo;stupid questions\u0026rdquo; at least one of which caused a major rethink and refactor. If Outcome v2 passes its second peer review, it\u0026rsquo;s because of Andrzej. Thank you.\nJonathan Müller invested countless hours in his doxygen replacement tool Standardese which Outcome uses to generate the reference API docs, and a not insignificant number of those went on fixing issues for Outcome. Thank you.\nSpecial thanks for Outcome v1 To Paul Bristow who proposed the name \u0026ldquo;Outcome\u0026rdquo; for the library after a very extended period of name bikeshedding on boost-dev. I had been minded to call the library \u0026ldquo;Boost.Donkey\u0026rdquo; just to shut everyone up because the name bike shedding was getting ridiculous. But Outcome is a lot nicer, so thank you Paul.\nMy heartfelt thanks to Charley Bay for acting as review manager for Outcome in May 2017. It is becoming ever harder to find a Boost review manager, so thank you! My thanks also to the CppCast team Rob Irving and Jason Turner for so quickly getting me on to CppCast to discuss expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; during the Outcome peer review to help publicise the review.\nMore general thanks are due to those on boost-dev, Reddit and SG14 for extensive and often very detailed feedback on the library pretty much from its beginning. You are all too numerous to remember, but certainly Tongari and Andrzej Krzemienski come to mind as having engaged in particularly long discussion threads with tons of useful feedback which clarified my thinking. Andrzej also went through the documentation with a fine toothed comb before the review, finding many small errata and confusing wording.\nFinally, my thanks to Vicente for driving Expected from its beginnings to hopefully standardisation before 2020. It\u0026rsquo;s many years of work getting something standardised, even more years than getting a library into Boost which as you can see from the history above took about three years.\n"

	"description": "How to informing `OUTCOME_TRY` about foreign Result types.",
	"content": " Outcome\u0026rsquo;s OUTCOME_TRY(var, expr) operation is fully extensible to accept as input any foreign types. It already recognises types matching the concepts::value_or_error\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; concept, which is to say all types which have:\n A public .has_value() member function which returns a bool. In order of preference, a public .assume_value()/.value() member function. In order of preference, a public .as_failure()/.assume_error()/.error() member function.  This should automatically handle inputs of std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;, and many others, including intermixing Boost.Outcome and standalone Outcome within the same translation unit.\nOUTCOME_TRY has the following free function customisation points:\n OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::try_operation_has_value(X) Returns a `bool` which is true if the input to TRY has a value. OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::try_operation_return_as(X) Returns a suitable failure_type\u0026lt;EC, EP = void\u0026gt; which is returned immediately to cause stack unwind. Ought to preserve rvalue semantics (i.e. if passed an rvalue, move the error state into the failure type). OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::try_operation_extract_value(X) Extracts a value type from the input for the `TRY` to set its variable. Ought to preserve rvalue semantics (i.e. if passed an rvalue, move the value).  New overloads of these to support additional input types must be injected into the OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE namespace before the compiler parses the relevant OUTCOME_TRY in order to be found. This is called \u0026lsquo;early binding\u0026rsquo; in the two phase name lookup model in C++. This was chosen over \u0026lsquo;late binding\u0026rsquo;, where an OUTCOME_TRY in a templated piece of code could look up overloads introduced after parsing the template containing the OUTCOME_TRY, because it has much lower impact on build times, as binding is done once at the point of parse, instead of on every occasion at the point of instantiation. If you are careful to ensure that you inject the overloads which you need early in the parse of the translation unit, all will be well.\nLet us work through an applied example.\nA very foreign pseudo-Expected type This is a paraphrase of a poorly written pseudo-Expected type which I once encountered in the production codebase of a large multinational. Lots of the code was already using it, and it was weird enough that it couldn\u0026rsquo;t be swapped out for something better easily.\nenum Errc { kBadValue }; template \u0026lt;classT, classE = Errc\u0026gt; struct ForeignExpected { T Value; E Error; int IsErrored; ForeignExpected(T v) : Value(v) , Error() , IsErrored(0) { } ForeignExpected(E e) : Value() , Error(e) , IsErrored(1) { } }; View this code on Github What we would like is for new code to be written using Outcome, but be able to transparently call old code, like this:\nForeignExpected\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; old_code(int a) // old code { if(0 == a) return kBadValue; return a; } outcome::result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; new_code(int a) // new code { OUTCOME_TRY(auto x, old_code(a)); return x; } View this code on Github Telling Outcome about this weird foreign Expected is straightforward:\nOUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE_BEGIN template \u0026lt;classT, classE\u0026gt; // inline bool try_operation_has_value(const ForeignExpected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; \u0026amp;v) { return 0 == v.IsErrored; } template \u0026lt;classT, classE\u0026gt; // inline auto try_operation_return_as(const ForeignExpected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; \u0026amp;v) { switch(v.Error) { case kBadValue: return failure(make_error_code(std::errc::argument_out_of_domain)); } abort(); } template \u0026lt;classT, classE\u0026gt; // inline auto try_operation_extract_value(const ForeignExpected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; \u0026amp;v) { return v.Value; } OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE_END View this code on Github And now OUTCOME_TRY works exactly as expected:\nauto printresult = [](const char *desc, auto x) { if(x) { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; desc \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34; returns successful \u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; x.value() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; } else { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; desc \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34; returns failure \u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; x.error().message() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; } }; printresult(\u0026#34;\\nnew_code(5)\u0026#34;, new_code(5)); printresult(\u0026#34;\\nnew_code(0)\u0026#34;, new_code(0)); View this code on Github \u0026hellip; which outputs:\nnew_code(5) returns successful 5 new_code(0) returns failure argument out of domain  "

	"content": " Outcome 2.2 library At the end of December 2021, Standalone Outcome went guaranteed future ABI stable. From v2.2.3 onwards, you get ABI compatibilty guarantees across Outcome releases.\n Outcome is a set of tools for reporting and handling function failures in contexts where directly using C++ exception handling is unsuitable. Such contexts include:\n there are programs, or parts thereof, that are compiled with exceptions disabled;\n there are parts of program that have a lot of branches depending on types of failures, where if-statements are cleaner than try-catch blocks;\n there is a hard requirement that the failure path of execution should not cost more than the successful path of execution;\n there are situations, like in the filesystem library, where whether the failure should be handled remotely (using a C++ exception throw), or locally cannot be made inside the function and needs to be decided by the caller, and in the latter case throwing a C++ exception is not desirable for the aforementioned reasons;\n there are parts of the program/framework that themselves implement exception handling and prefer to not use exceptions to propagate failure reports across threads, tasks, fibers, etc;\n one needs to propagate exceptions through layers that do not implement exception throw safety;\n there is an external requirement (such as a company-wide policy) that failure handling paths are explicitly indicated in the code.\n where interoperation with C code, without having to resort to C++ exception wrapper shims, is important.\n  Outcome addresses failure handling through returning a special type from functions, which is able to store either a successfully computed value (or void), or the information about failure. Outcome also comes with a set of idioms for dealing with such types.\nParticular care has been taken to ensure that Outcome has the lowest possible impact on build times, thus making it suitable for use in the global headers of really large codebases. Storage layout is guaranteed and is C-compatible for result\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt;1, thus making Outcome based code long term ABI-stable.\nFully deterministic all-noexcept C++ Coroutine support in Outcome is particularly strong, and we supply Outcome-optimising eager\u0026lt;T, Executor = void\u0026gt;/atomic_eager\u0026lt;T, Executor = void\u0026gt; , lazy\u0026lt;T, Executor = void\u0026gt;/atomic_lazy\u0026lt;T, Executor = void\u0026gt; and generator\u0026lt;T, Executor = void\u0026gt; awaitables which work for any user type.\nSample usage The main workhorse in the Outcome library is result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;: it represents either a successfully computed value of type T, or a std::error_code/boost::system::error_code2 representing the reason for failure. You use it in the function\u0026rsquo;s return type:\noutcome::result\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; data_from_file(string_view path) noexcept; View this code on Github It is possible to inspect the state manually:\nif (outcome::result\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; rslt = data_from_file(\u0026#34;config.cfg\u0026#34;)) use_string(rslt.value()); // returns string else throw LibError{rslt.error(), \u0026#34;config.cfg\u0026#34;}; // returns error_code View this code on Github Or, if this function is called in another function that also returns result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;, you can use a dedicated control statement:\noutcome::result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; process(const string\u0026amp; content) noexcept; outcome::result\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; int_from_file(string_view path) noexcept { OUTCOME_TRY(auto str, data_from_file(path)); // if control gets here data_from_file() has succeeded  return process(str); // decltype(str) == string } View this code on Github OUTCOME_TRY is a control statement. If the returned result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; object contains an error information, the enclosing function is immediately returned with result\u0026lt;U\u0026gt; containing the same failure information; otherwise an automatic object of type T is available in scope.\nThis library joined the Boost C++ libraries in the 1.70 release (Spring 2019). It can be grafted into much older Boost releases if desired.\n  If you choose a C-compatible T and E type. [return] result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; defaults to std::error_code for Standalone Outcome, and to boost::system::error_code for Boost.Outcome. You can mandate a choice using std_result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; or boost_result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;. [return]   "

CopyAssignable, if all of value_type, error_type and exception_type implement copy constructors and copy assignment. Destructible. Swappable, with the strong rather than weak guarantee. See void swap(basic_outcome \u0026amp;) for more information. TriviallyCopyable, if all of value_type, error_type and exception_type are trivially copyable. TrivialType, if all of value_type, error_type and exception_type are trivial types. LiteralType, if all of value_type, error_type and exception_type are literal types. StandardLayoutType. It is implementation defined if basic_outcome can be used by C. However all of the three major compilers MSVC, GCC and clang implement C layout of basic_outcome as follows:\nstruct outcome_layout { struct trivially_copyable_result_layout { union { value_type value; error_type error; }; unsigned int flags; }; exception_type exception; };  \u0026hellip; if both value_type and error_type are TriviallyCopyable, otherwise:\nstruct outcome_layout { struct non_trivially_copyable_result_layout { value_type value; unsigned int flags; error_type error; }; exception_type exception; };  If you choose standard layout value_type, error_type and exception_type, basic_outcome works fine from C on MSVC, GCC and clang.\n EqualityComparable, if all of value_type, error_type and exception_type implement equality comparisons with one another.\n LessThanComparable, not implemented due to availability of implicit conversions from value_type, error_type and exception_type, this can cause major surprise (i.e. hard to diagnose bugs), so we don\u0026rsquo;t implement these at all.\n Hash, not implemented as a generic implementation of a unique hash for non-valued items which are unequal would require a dependency on RTTI being enabled.\n  Thus basic_outcome meets the Regular concept if all of value_type, error_type and exception_type are Regular, except for the lack of a default constructor. Often where one needs a default constructor, wrapping basic_outcome into  std::optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; will suffice.\nPublic member functions Disabling constructors  basic_outcome(Args...) = delete Disabling catchall constructor used to give useful diagnostic error when trying to use non-inplace constructors when predicate::constructors_enabled is false.\n basic_outcome(X \u0026amp;\u0026amp;) = delete Disabling implicit constructor used to give useful diagnostic error when trying to use implicit constructors when predicate::implicit_constructors_enabled is false.\n Copy and move constructors and assignment, and destructor  basic_outcome() = delete The default constructor (disabled).\n basic_outcome(basic_outcome \u0026amp;\u0026amp;) Move constructor.

Unlike  P0323 std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; , Outcome\u0026rsquo;s result type is designed specifically for convenience when implementing failure handling across very large codebases, and it has a number of API differences to facilitate that.\nThe first major design difference is that basic result models its constructor design on  std::variant\u0026lt;...\u0026gt; , rather than modelling  std::optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; \u0026rsquo;s constructor design like std::expected\u0026lt;T, E\u0026gt; does. This means that basic result will implicitly construct either a T or an E if doing so is unambiguous, same as variant does. Where implicit construction is ambiguous, the implicit constructors disable and a T or E can be specified via in_place_type_t\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; , or via success_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; or failure_type\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; . We implement a subset of variant\u0026rsquo;s constructors for improved compile time impact, so the implicit and explicit constructor design is split into fixed subsets to reduce SFINAE execution.\nThe second major design difference is that union storage is ONLY used when both T and E are trivially copyable or void, otherwise struct storage is used. This is usually not a problem, as it is assumed that sizeof(E) will be small for failure handling. The choice to only use union storage for trivially copyable types only very considerably reduces load on the compiler, and substantially improves compile times in very large C++ 14 codebases, because copies and moves do not need to jump through complex ceremony in order to implement the never-empty guarantees which would be required in a union storage based implementation (C++ 17 onwards does far fewer copy and move constructor instantiations, but it all adds up \u0026ndash; work avoided is always the fastest).\nPublic member type aliases  value_type is T. error_type is E. no_value_policy_type is NoValuePolicy. value_type_if_enabled is T if construction from T is available, else it is a usefully named unusable internal type. error_type_if_enabled is E if construction from E is available, else it is a usefully named unusable internal type. rebind\u0026lt;A, B = E, C = NoValuePolicy\u0026gt; is basic_result\u0026lt;A, B, C\u0026gt;.

Either, but not both, of value_type is explicitly constructible from Args... or error_type is explicitly constructible from Args....   Summary of standard requirements provided  DefaultConstructible, always deleted to force user to choose valued or errored for every result instanced. MoveConstructible, if both value_type and error_type implement move constructors. CopyConstructible, if both value_type and error_type implement copy constructors. MoveAssignable, if both value_type and error_type implement move constructors and move assignment. CopyAssignable, if both value_type and error_type implement copy constructors and copy assignment. Destructible. Swappable, with the strong rather than weak guarantee. See void swap(basic_result \u0026amp;) for more information. TriviallyCopyable, if both value_type and error_type are trivially copyable. TrivialType, if both value_type and error_type are trivial types. LiteralType, if both value_type and error_type are literal types. StandardLayoutType, if both value_type and error_type are standard layout types. If so, layout of basic_result in C is guaranteed to be one of:\nstruct trivially_copyable_result_layout { union { value_type value; error_type error; }; unsigned int flags; };  \u0026hellip; if both value_type and error_type are TriviallyCopyable, otherwise:\nstruct non_trivially_copyable_result_layout { value_type value; unsigned int flags; error_type error; };  Obviously, all C compatible C++ types are TriviallyCopyable, so if you are passing non-trivially copyable types from C++ to C, you are doing undefined behaviour.\n EqualityComparable, if both value_type and error_type implement equality comparisons with one another.\n LessThanComparable, not implemented due to availability of implicit conversions from value_type and error_type, this can cause major surprise (i.e. hard to diagnose bugs), so we don\u0026rsquo;t implement these at all.\n Hash, not implemented as a generic implementation of a unique hash for non-valued items which are unequal would require a dependency on RTTI being enabled.\n  Thus basic_result meets the Regular concept if both value_type and error_type are Regular, except for the lack of a default constructor. Often where one needs a default constructor, wrapping basic_result into  std::optional\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; will suffice.\nPublic member functions Disabling constructors  basic_result(Args...) = delete Disabling catchall constructor used to give useful diagnostic error when trying to use non-inplace constructors when predicate::constructors_enabled is false.\n basic_result(X \u0026amp;\u0026amp;) = delete Disabling implicit constructor used to give useful diagnostic error when trying to use implicit constructors when predicate::implicit_constructors_enabled is false.\n Copy and move constructors and assignment, and destructor  basic_result() = delete The default constructor (disabled).\n basic_result(basic_result \u0026amp;\u0026amp;) Move constructor.

	"description": "A lazily evaluated coroutine awaitable with Outcome customisation.",
	"content": "This is very similar to eager\u0026lt;T, Executor = void\u0026gt; , except that execution of the lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; returning function suspends immediately. Functions which return lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; are therefore suitable for tasks which you need to instantiate right now, but whose execution will occur elsewhere e.g. in a separate kernel thread. Because of the very common use case of using worker threads to execute the body of lazily executed coroutines, most people will want to use atomic_lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; instead of lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;.\natomic_lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; is like lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;, except that the setting of the coroutine result performs an atomic release, whilst the checking of whether the coroutine has finished is an atomic acquire.\nlazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; has similar semantics to std::lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;, which is being standardised. See https://wg21.link/P1056 Add lazy coroutine (coroutine task) type.\nThe Executor template parameter is purely for compatibility with third party software such as ASIO, and this awaitable can be directly used by ASIO.\nExample of use (must be called from within a coroutinised function):\nlazy\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; func(int x) { co_return x + 1; } ... // Always suspends perhaps causing other coroutines to execute, then resumes. int r = co_await func(5);  lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; has special semantics if T is a type capable of constructing from an exception_ptr or error_code \u0026ndash; any exceptions thrown during the function\u0026rsquo;s body are sent via T, preferably via the error code route if error_from_exception( ) successfully matches the exception throw. This means that a basic_result\u0026lt;T, E, NoValuePolicy\u0026gt; or basic_outcome\u0026lt;T, EC, EP, NoValuePolicy\u0026gt; where one of its types is is compatible will have its .error() or .exception() set.\nNote that lazy\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; does not otherwise transport exception throws, and rethrows any exceptions thrown within the coroutine body through the coroutine machinery. This does not produce reliable consequences in current C++ compilers. You should therefore wrap the coroutine body in a try...catch if T is not able to transport exceptions on its own.\nRequires: C++ coroutines to be available in your compiler.\nNamespace: OUTCOME_V2_NAMESPACE::awaitables\nHeader: \u0026lt;outcome/coroutine_support.hpp\u0026gt;\n"
