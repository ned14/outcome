      <description>In the start of 2020, after a year of listening to user feedback since entering Boost, Outcome v2.2 was published with a number of breaking source changes from Outcome v2.1 The full year of 2020 (three Boost releases) was given to announcing those upcoming changes, and testing the v2.2 branch in production. In late December 2020, Outcome v2.2 became the default Outcome, and all Outcome v2.1 code shall need to be upgraded to work with v2.</description>

      <title>v2.2 major changes</title>

      <description>Major changes in v2.2 over v2.1 are listed here.
 A new trait is_move_bitcopying&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; is added, which opts types into a library-based emulation of P1029 move = bitcopies. Experimental std::error is opted in by default. If this trait is true for your T or E type, Outcome will track moved-from status for your type, and will only call your type&amp;rsquo;s destructor if it was not moved from. If your compiler&amp;rsquo;s optimiser is sufficiently able to fold code, this improves codegen quality for Experimental Outcome very considerably, approaching the same gains as P1029 types would have.</description>
